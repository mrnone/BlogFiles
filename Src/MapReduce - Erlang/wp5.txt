It would be too painful to me to think that I 
night be a cause of sorrow or discord in the fam- 
ly that has been so good to me (she wrote), and 
ny love has no aim but the happiness of those I 
ove; so, Nicholas, I beg you to consider yourself 
r rce, and to be assured that, in spite of everything, 
10 one can love you more than does 

YOUR SONYA 

Both letters were written from Tr6itsa. The 
:&gt;ther, from the countess, described their last 
iays in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and 
the destruction of all their property. In this 
letter the countess also mentioned that Prince 
\ndrew was among the wounded traveling 
ivith them; his state was very critical, but the 
:ioctor said there was now more hope. S6nya 
md Natasha were nursing him. 

Next day Nicholas took his mother's letter 
ind went to see Princess Mary. Neither he nor 
&gt;he said a word about what "Natasha nursing 
him" might mean, but thanks to this letter 
Nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate 
with the princess as if they were relations. 

The following day he saw Princess Mary off 
an her journey to Yaroslavl, and a few days 
later left to rejoin his regiment. 

CHAPTER VIII 

SONYA'S LETTKR written from Tr6itsa, which 
had come as an answer to Nicholas* prayer, was 
prompted by this: the thought of getting Nich- 
olas married to an heiress occupied the old 
countess' mind more and more. She knew that 
&gt;6nya was the chief obstacle to this happening, 
and Sonya's life in the countess' house had 
Epown harder and harder, especially after they 
had received a letter from Nicholas telling of 
his meeting with Princess Mary in Bogucharo- 
vo. The countess let no occasion slip of mak- 
ing humiliating or cruel allusions to Sonya. 

But a few days before they left Moscow, 
moved and excited by all that was going on, 
she called S6nya to her and, instead of re- 
proaching and making demands on her, tear- 
fully implored her to sacrifice herself and re- 
pay all that the family had done for her by 
breaking off her engagement with Nicholas. 

"I shall not be at peace till you promise me 
this." 

S6nya burst into hysterical tears and replied 
through her sobs that she would do anything 
and was prepared for anything, but gave no 
actual promise and could not bring herself to 
decide to do what was demanded of her. She 
must sacrifice herself for the family that had 
reared and brought her up. To sacrifice her- 



self for others was Sonya's habit. Her position 
in the house was such that only by sacrifice 
could she show her worth, and she was accus- 
tomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her 
former acts of self-sacrifice she had been hap- 
pily conscious that they raised her in her own 
esteem and in that of others, and so made her 
more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more 
than anything in the world. But now they 
wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that con- 
stituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice 
and the whole meaning of her life. And for the 
first time she felt bitterness against those who 
had been her benefactors only to torture her 
the more painfully; she felt jealous of Natasha 
who had never experienced anything of this 
sort, had never needed to sacrifice herself, but 
made others sacrifice themselves for her and 
yet was beloved by everybody. And for the first 
time S6nya felt that out of her pure, quiet love 
for Nicholas a passionate feeling was begin- 
ning to grow up which was stronger than prin- 
ciple, virtue, or religion. Under the influence 
of this feeling S6nya, whose life of dependence 
had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, 
having answered the countess in vague general 
terms, avoided talking with her and resolved 
to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in or- 
der to set him free but on the contrary at that 
meeting to bind him to her forever. 

The bustle and terror of the Rostovs' last 
days in Moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts 
that oppressed Sonya. She was glad to find es- 
cape from them in practical activity. But when 
she heard of Prince Andrew's presence in their 
house, despite her sincere pity for him and for 
Natdsha, she was seized by a joyful and super- 
stitious feeling that God did not intend her to 
be separated from Nicholas. She knew that 
Natasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and 
had never ceased to love him. She knew that 
being thrown together again under such ter- 
rible circumstances they would again fall in 
love with one another, and that Nicholas would 
then not be able to marry Princess Mary as 
they would be within the prohibited degrees 
of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had 
happened during those last days and during 
the first days of their journey, this feeling that 
Providence was intervening in her personal 
affairs cheered Sonya. 

At the Tr6itsa monastery the Rost6vs first 
broke their journey for a whole day. 

Three large rooms were assigned to them in 
the monastery hostelry, one of which was oc- 
cupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man 



546 WAR AND PEACE 

was much better that day and Natdsha was sit- 
ting with him. In the next room sat the count 
and countess respectfully conversing with the 
prior, who was calling on them as old acquaint- 
ances and benefactors of the monastery. S6n- 
ya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to 
what Prince Andrew and Natasha were talking 
about. She heard the sound of their voices 
through the door. That door opened and Na- 
tdsha came out, looking excited. Not noticing 
the monk, who had risen to greet her and was 
drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm, 
she went up to S6nya and took her hand. 

"Natdsha, what are you about? Come here!" 
said the countess. 

Natdsha went up to the monk for his bless- 
ing, and he advised her to turn for aid to God 
and His saint. 

As soon as the prior withdrew, Natdsha took 
her friend by the hand and went with her into 
the unoccupied room. 

"S6nya, will he live?" she asked. "S6nya, 
how happy I am, and how unhappy! . . . S6n- 
ya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only 
he lives! He cannot . . . because . . . because . . . 
of . . ." and Natdsha burst into tears. 

"Yes! I knew it! Thank God!" murmured 
S6nya. "He will live." 

Sonya was not less agitated than her friend 
by the latter's fear and grief and by her own 
personal feelings which she shared with no 
one. Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natd- 
sha. "If only he lives!" she thought. Having 
wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the 
two friends went together to Prince Andrew's 
door. Natdsha opened it cautiously and glanced 
into the room, S6nya standing beside her at 
the half-open door. 

Prince Andrew was lying raised high on 
three pillows. His pale face was calm, his eyes 
closed, and they could see his regular breath- 
ing. 

"O, Natdsha!" S6nya suddenly almost 
screamed, catching her companion's arm and 
stepping back from the door. 

"What? What is it?" asked Natdsha. 

"It's that, that . . ." said S6nya, with a white 
face and trembling lips. 

Natdsha softly closed the door and went with 
Sonya to the window, not yet understanding 
what the latter was telling her. 

"You remember," said S6nya with a solemn 
and frightened expression. "You remember 
when I looked in the mirror for you ... at 
Otrddnoe at Christinas? Do you remember 
what I saw?" 



"Yes, yes!" cried Natdsha opening her eyes 
wide, and vaguely recalling that S6nya had 
told her something about Prince Andrew 
whom she had seen lying down. 

"You remember?" S6nya went on. "I saw 
it then and told everybody, you and Dunydsha. 
I saw him lying on a bed," said she, making a 
gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at 
each detail, "and that he had his eyes closed 
and was covered just with a pink quilt,, and 
that his hands were folded," she concluded, 
convincing herself that the details she had just 
seen were exactly what she had seen in the 
mirror. 

She had in fact seen nothing then but had 
mentioned the first thing that came into her 
head, but what she had invented then seemed 
to her now as real as any other recollection. 
She not only remembered what she had then 
saidthat he turned to look at her and smiled 
and was covered with something red but was 
firmly convinced that she had then seen and 
said that he was covered with a pink quilt and 
that his eyes were closed. 

"Yes, yes, it really was pink!" cried Natdsha, 
who now thought she too remembered the 
word pink being used, and saw in this the 
most extraordinary and mysterious part of the 
prediction. 

"But what does it mean?" she added medita- 
tively. 

"Oh, I don't know, it is all so strange," re- 
plied S6nya, clutching at her head. 

A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang 
and Natdsha went to him, but S6nya, feeling 
unusually excited and touched, remained at 
the window thinking about the strangeness of 
what had occurred. 



They had an opportunity that day to send 
letters to the army, and the countess was writ- 
ing to her son. 

"S6nyal" said the countess, raising her eyes 
from her letter as her niece passed, "S6nya, 
won't you write to Nicholas?" She spoke in a 
soft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes 
that looked over her spectacles S6nya read all 
that the countess meant to convey with these 
words. Those eyes expressed entreaty, shame 
at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and readi- 
ness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal. 

S6nya went up to the countess and, kneeling 
down, kissed her hand. 

"Yes, Mamma, I will write," said she. 

S6nya was softened, excited, and touched by 
all that had occurred that day, especially by 



BOOK TWELVE 

the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of 
her vision. Now that she knew that the renewal 
of Natdsha's relations with Prince Andrew 
would prevent Nicholas from marrying Prin- 
cess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a re- 
turn of that self-sacrificing spirit in which she 
was accustomed to live and loved to live. So 
with a joyful consciousness of performing a 
magnanimous deedinterrupted several times 
by the tears that dimmed her velvety black 
eyes she wrote that touching letter the arrival 
of which had so amazed Nicholas.

CHAPTER IX 

THE OFFICER AND SOLDIERS who had arrested 
Pierre treated him with hostility but yet with 
respect, in the guardhouse to which he was 
taken. In their attitude toward him could still 
be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be 
perhaps a very important person and hostil- 
ity as a result of their recent personal conflict 
with him. 

But when the guard was relieved next morn- 
ing, Pierre felt that for the new guard both 
officers and men he was not as interesting as 
he had been to his captors; and in fact the 
guard of the second day did not recognize in 
this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigor- 
ous person who had fought so desperately with 
the marauder and the convoy and had uttered 
those solemn words about saving a child; they 
saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Rus- 
sians, arrested and detained for some reason 
by order of the Higher Command. If they 
noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it 
was only his unabashed, meditative concentra- 
tion and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke 
French, which struck them as surprisingly 
good. In spite of this he was placed that day 
with the other arrested suspects, as the sepa- 
rate room he had occupied was required by an 
officer. 

All the Russians confined with Pierre were 
men of the lowest class and, recognizing him 
as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more es- 
pecially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at 
hearing them making fun of him. 

That evening he learned that all these pris- 
oners (he, probably, among them) were to be 
tried for incendiarism. On the third day he 
was taken with the others to a house where a 
French general with a white mustache sat with 
two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves 
on their arms. With the precision and definite- 
ness customary in addressing prisoners, and 
which is supposed to preclude human frailty, 



Pierre like the others was questioned as to who 
he was, where he had been, with what object, 
and so on. 

These questions, like questions put at trials 
generally, left the essence of the matter aside, 
shut out the possibility of that essence's being 
revealed, and were designed only to form a 
channel through which the judges wished the 
answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to 
the desired result, namely a conviction. As 
soon as Pierre began to say anything that did 
not fit in with that aim, the channel was re- 
moved and the water could flow to waste. Pierre 
felt, moreover, what the accused always feel at 
their trial, perplexity as to why these questions 
were put to him. He had a feeling that it was 
only out of condescension or a kind of civility 
that this device of placing a channel was em- 
ployed. He knew he was in these men's power, 
that only by force had they brought him there, 
that force alone gave them the right to de- 
mand answers to their questions, and that the 
sole object of that assembly was to inculpate 
him. And so, as they had the power and wish 
to inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry 
and trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident 
that any answer would lead to conviction. 
When asked what he was doing when he was 
arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic man- 
ner that he was restoring to its parents a child 
he had saved from the flames. Why had he 
fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he 
"was protecting a woman," and that "to pro- 
tect a woman who was being insulted was the 
duty of every man; that . . ." They interrupted 
him, for this was not to the point. Why was he 
in the yard of a burning house where witnesses 
had seen him? He replied that he had gone 
out to see what was happening in Moscow. 
Again they interrupted him: they had not 
asked where he was going, but why he was 
found near the fire? Who was he? they asked, 
repeating their first question, which he had de- 
clined to answer. Again he replied that he 
could not answer it. 

"Put that down, that's bad . . . very bad/' 
sternly remarked the general with the white 
mustache and red flushed face. 

On the fourth day fires broke out on the 
Ziibovski rampart. 

Pierre and thirteen others were moved to 
the coach house of a merchant's house near 
the Crimean bridge. On his way through the 
streets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which 
seemed to hang over the whole city. Fires were 



548 WAR AND PEACE 

visible on all sides. He did not then realize the 
significance of the burning of Moscow, and 
looked at the fires with horror. 

He passed four days in the coach house near 
the Crimean bridge and during that time 
learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, 
that all those confined there were awaiting a 
decision which might come any day from the 
marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could 
not learn from the soldiers. Evidently for them 
"the marshal "represented a very high and rath- 
er mysterious power. 

These first days, before the eighth of Sep- 
tember when the prisoners were had up for a 
second examination, were the hardest of all 
for Pierre. 



CHAPTER X 

ON THE EIGHTH OF SEPTEMBER an officer avery 
important one judging by the respect the 
guards showed him entered the coach house 
where the prisoners were. This officer, proba- 
bly someone on the staff, was holding a paper 
in his hand, and called over all the Russians 
there, naming Pierre as "the man who does 
not give his name." Glancing indolently and 
indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered 
the officer in charge to have them decently 
dressed and tidied up before taking them to 
the marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers 
arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led 
to the Virgin's Field. It was a fine day, sunny 
after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The 
smoke did not hang low as on the day when 
Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse 
on the Zubovski rampart, but rose through the 
pure air in columns. No flames were seen, but 
columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all 
Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast 
charred ruin. On all sides there were waste 
spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks 
still standing, and here and there the black- 
ened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed 
at the ruins and did not recognize districts he 
had known well. Here and there he could see 
churches that had not been burned. The Krm- 
lin, which was not destroyed, gleamed white in 
the distance with its towers and the belfry of 
Ivan the Great. The domes of the New Con- 
vent of the Virgin glittered brightly and its 
bells were ringing particularly clearly. These 
bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and 
the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin. But 
there seemed to be no one to celebrate this 
holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and 
the few Russians to be seen were tattered and . 



frightened people who tried to hide when they 
saw the French. 

It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined 
and destroyed, but in place of the Russian or- 
der of life that had been destroyed, Pierre un- 
consciously felt that a quite different, firm, 
French order had been established over this 
ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of the sol- 
diers who, marching in regular ranks briskly 
and gaily, were escorting him and the other 
criminals; he felt it in the looks of an impor- 
tant French official in a carriage and pair driven 
by a soldier, whom they met on the way. He 
felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music 
he heard from the left side of the field, and felt 
and realized it especially from the list of pris- 
oners the French officer had read out when he 
came that morning. Pierre had been taken by 
one set of soldiers and led first to one and then 
to another place with dozens of other men, and 
it seemed that they might have forgotten him, 
or confused him with the others. But no: the 
answers he had given when questioned had 
come back to him in his designation as "the 
man who does not give his name," and under 
that appellation, which to Pierre seemed ter- 
rible, they were now leading him somewhere 
with unhesitating assurance on their faces that 
he and all the other prisoners were exactly the 
ones they wanted and that they were being 
taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself 
to be an insignificant chip fallen among the 
wheels of a machine whose action he did not 
understand but which was working well. 

He and the other prisoners were taken to 
the right side of the Virgin's Field, to a large 
white house with an immense garden not far 
from the convent. This was Prince Shcherba- 
tov's house, where Pierre had often been in 
other days, and which, as he learned from the 
talk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the 
marshal, the Duke of Eckmiihl (Davout). 

They were taken to the entrance and led in- 
to the house one by one. Pierre was the sixth 
to enter. He was conducted through a glass 
gallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were 
familiar to him, into a long low study at the 
door of which stood an adjutant. 

Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a 
table at the further end of the room. Pierre 
went close up to him, but Davout, evidently 
consulting a paper that lay before him, did not 
look up. Without raising his eyes, he said in a 
low voice: &lt; 

"Who are you?" 

Pierre was silent because he was incapable 



BOOK TWELVE 

of uttering a word. To him Davout was not 
merely a French general, but a man notorious 
for his cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he 
sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared 
to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that 
every instant of delay might cost him his life; 
but he did not know what to say. He did not 
venture to repeat what he had said at his first 
examination, yet to disclose his rank and posi- 
tion was dangerous and embarrassing. So he 
was silent. But before he had decided what to 
do, Davout raised his head, pushed his spec- 
tacles back on his forehead, screwed up his 
eyes, and looked intently at him. 

"I know that man," he said in a cold, meas- 
ured tone, evidently calculated to frighten 
Pierre. 

The chill that had been running down 
Pierre's back now seized his head as in a vise. 

"You cannot know me, General, I have nev- 
er seen you . . ." 

"He is a Russian spy," Davout interrupted, 
addressing another general who was present, 
but whom Pierre had not noticed. 

Davout turned away. With an unexpected 
reverberation in his voice Pierre rapidly be- 
gan: 

"No, monseigneur," he said, suddenly re- 
membering that Davout was a duke. "No, mon- 
seigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a 
militia officer and have not quitted Moscow." 

"Your name?" asked Davout. 

"Bezukhov." 

"What proof have I that you are not lying?" 

"Monseigneur!" exclaimed Pierre, not in an 
offended but in a pleading voice. 

Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. 
For some seconds they looked at one another, 
and that look saved Pierre. Apart from condi- 
tions of war and law, that look established hu- 
man relations between the two men. At that 
moment an immense number of things passed 
dimly through both their minds, and they re- 
alized that they were both children of human- 
ity and were brothers. 

At the first glance, when Davout had only 
raised his head from the papers where human 
affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, 
Pierre was merely a circumstance, and Davout 
could have shot him without burdening his 
conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw 
in him a human being. He reflected for a mo- 
ment. 

"How can you show me that you are telling 
the truth?" said Davout coldly. 

Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named 



549 

him and his regiment and the street where the 
house was. 

"You are not what you say," returned Da- 
vout. 

In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began 
adducing proofs of the truth of his statements. 

But at that moment an adjutant entered and 
reported something to Davout. 

Davout brightened up at the news the ad- 
jutant brought, and began buttoning up his 
uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten 
Pierre. 

When the adjutant reminded him of the 
prisoner, he jerked his head in Pierre's direc- 
tion with a frown and ordered him to be led 
away. But where they were to take him Pierre 
did not know: back to the coach house or to 
the place of execution his companions had 
pointed out to him as they crossed the Virgin's 
Field. 

He turned his head and saw that the adju- 
tant was putting another question to Davout. 

"Yes, of coursel" replied Davout, but what 
this "yes" meant, Pierre did not know. 

Pierre could not afterwards remember how 
he went, whether it was far, or in which direc- 
tion. His faculties were quite numbed, he was 
stupefied, and noticing nothing around him 
went on moving his legs as the others did till 
they all stopped and he stopped too. The only 
thought in his mind at that time was: who was 
it that had really sentenced him to death? Not 
the men on the commission that had first ex- 
amined him not one of them had wished to 
or, evidently, could have done it. It was not 
Davout, who had looked at him in so human a 
way. In another moment Davout would have 
realized that he was doing wrong, but just then 
the adjutant had come in and interrupted him. 
The adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil 
intent though he might have refrained from 
coming in. Then who was executing him, kill- 
ing him, depriving him of life him, Pierre, 
with all his memories, aspirations, hopes, and 
thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre felt 
that it was no one. 

It was a system a concurrence of circum- 
stances. 

A system of some sort was killing him 
Pierre depriving him of life, of everything, 
annihilating him. 



CHAPTER XI 

FROM PRINCE SHCHERBJITOV'S house the pris- 
oners were led straight down the Virgin's Field, 
to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen 



55&lt;&gt; 



WAR AND PEACE 



garden in which a post had been set up. Be- 
yond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the 
ground, and near the post and the pit a large 
crowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd con- 
sisted of a few Russians and many of Napo- 
leon's soldiers who were not on dutyGer- 
mans, Italians, and Frenchmen, in a variety of 
uniforms. To the right and left of the post 
stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms 
with red epaulets and high boots and shakos. 

The prisoners were placed in a certain or- 
der, according to the list (Pierre was sixth), 
and were led to the post. Several drums sud- 
denly began to beat on both sides of them, 
and at that sound Pierre felt as if part of his 
soul had been torn away. He lost the power of 
thinking or understanding. He could only hear 
and see. And he had only one wish that the 
frightful thing that had to happen should hap- 
pen quickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow 
prisoners and scrutinized them. 

The two first were convicts with shaven heads. 
One was tall and thin, the other dark, shaggy, 
and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was a 
domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with 
grizzled hair and a plump, well-nourished body. 
The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome 
man with a broad, light-brown beard and black 
eyes. The fifth was a factory hand, a thin, 
sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat. 

Pierre heard the French consulting whether 
to shoot them separately or two at a time. "In 
couples," replied the officer in command in a 
calm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of 
the soldiers and it was evident that they were 
all hurrying not as men hurry to do some- 
thing they understand, but as people hurry to 
finish a necessary but unpleasant and incom- 
prehensible task. 

A French official wearing a scarf came up to 
the right of the row of prisoners and read out 
the sentence in Russian and in French. 

Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached 
the criminals and at the officer's command took 
the two convicts who stood first in the row. 
The convicts stopped when they reached the 
post and, while sacks were being brought, 
looked dumbly around as a wounded beast 
looks at an approaching huntsman. One crossed 
himself continually, the other scratched his 
back and made a movement of the lips resem- 
bling a smile. With hurried hands the soldiers 
blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their 
heads, and bound them to the post. 

Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped 
out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and 



halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned 
away to avoid seeing what was going to hap- 
pen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling noise was 
heard which seemed to him louder than the 
most terrific thunder, and he looked round. 
There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen 
were doing something near the pit, with pale 
faces and trembling hands. Two more prisoners 
were led up. In the same way and with similar 
looks, these two glanced vainly at the onlook- 
ers with only a silent appeal for protection in 
their eyes, evidently unable to understand or 
believe what was going to happen to them. 
They could not believe it because they alone 
knew what their life meant to them, and so 
they neither understood nor believed that it 
could be taken from them. 

Again Pierre did not wish to look and again 
turned away; but again the sound as of a fright- 
ful explosion struck his ear, and at the same 
moment he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, 
scared faces of the Frenchmen who were again 
doing something by the post, their trembling 
hands impeding one another. Pierre, breath- 
ing heavily, looked around as if asking what it 
meant. The same question was expressed in 
all the looks that met his. 

On the faces of all the Russians and of the 
French soldiers and officers without exception, 
he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict 
that were in his own heart. "But who, after all, 
is doing this? They are all suffering as I am. 
Who then is it? Who?" flashed for an instant 
through his mind. 

"Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward I" 
shouted someone. The fifth prisoner, the one 
next to Pierre, was led away alone. Pierre did 
not understand that he was saved, that he and 
the rest had been brought there only to wit- 
ness the execution. With ever-growing horror, 
and no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what 
was taking place. The fifth man was the factory 
lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid 
hands on him he sprang aside in terror and 
clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and 
shook himself free.) The lad was unable to 
walk. They dragged him along, holding him 
up under the arms, and he screamed. When 
they got him to the post he grew quiet, as if he 
suddenly understood something. Whether he 
understood tha t screami ng was useless or wheth- 
er he thought it incredible that men should 
kill him, at any rate he took his stand at the 
post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, 
and like a wounded animal looked around 
him with glittering eyes. 



BOOK TWELVE 

Pierre was no longer able to turn away and 
close his eyes. His curiosity and agitation, like 
that of the whole crowd, reached the highest 
pitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this 
fifth man seemed calm; he wrapped his loose 
cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with 
the other. 

When they began to blindfold him he him- 
self adjusted the knot which hurt the back of 
his head; then when they propped him against 
the bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not 
being comfortable in that position, straight- 
ened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back 
again more comfortably. Pierre did not take 
his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest 
movement. 

Probably a word of command was given and 
was followed by the reports of eight muskets; 
but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards 
remember having heard the slightest sound of 
the shots. He only saw how the workman sud- 
denly sank down on the cords that held him, 
how blood showed itself in two places, how 
the ropes slackened under the weight of the 
hanging body, and how the workman sat down, 
his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent 
under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one 
hindered him. Pale, frightened people were 
doing something around the workman. The 
lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick 
mustache trembled as he untied the ropes. The 
body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awk- 
wardly from the post and began pushing it in- 
to the pit. 

They all plainly and certainly knew that 
they were criminals who must hide the traces 
of their guilt as quickly as possible. 

Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the 
factory lad was lying with his knees close up 
to his head and one shoulder higher than the 
other. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmical- 
ly and convulsively, but spadefuls of earth were 
already being thrown over the whole body. 
One of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted 
gruffly and angrily at Pierre to go back. But 
Pierre did not understand him and remained 
near the post, and no one drove him away. 

When the pit had been filled up a command 
was given. Pierre was taken back to his place, 
and the rows of troops on both sides of the 
post made a half turn and went past it at a 
measured pace. The twenty-four sharpshooters 
with discharged muskets, standing in the cen- 
ter of the circle, ran back to their places as the 
companies passed by. 

Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these 



55 1 

sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the 
circle. All but one rejoined their companies. 
This one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, 
his shako pushed back, and his musket resting 
on the ground, still stood near the pit at the 
spot from which he had fired. He swayed like 
a drunken man, taking some steps forward and 
back to save himself from falling. An old, non- 
commissioned officer ran out of the ranks and 
taking him by the elbow dragged him to his 
company. The crowd of Russians and French- 
men began to disperse. They all went away 
silently and with drooping heads. 

"That will teach them to start fires," said 
one of the Frenchmen. 

Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw 
that it was a soldier who was trying to find 
some relief after what had been done, but was 
not able to do so. Without finishing what he 
had begun to say he made a hopeless move- 
ment with his arm and went away. 

CHAPTER XII 

AFTER THE EXECUTION Pierre was separated 
from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone 
in a small, ruined, and befouled church. 

Toward evening a noncommissioned officer 
entered with two soldiers and told him that he 
had been pardoned and would now go to the 
barracks for the prisoners of war. Without un- 
derstanding what was said to him, Pierre got 
up and went with the soldiers. They took him 
to the upper end of the field, where there were 
some sheds built of charred planks, beams, and 
battens, and led him into one of them. In the 
darkness some twenty different men surround- 
ed Pierre. He looked at them without under- 
standing who they were, why they were there, 
or what they wanted of him. He heard what 
they said, but did not understand the meaning 
of the words and made no kind of deduction 
from or application of them. He replied to 
questions they put to him, but did not consid- 
er who was listening to his replies, nor how 
they would understand them. He looked at 
their faces and figures, but they all seemed to 
him equally meaningless. 

From the moment Pierre had witnessed those 
terrible murders committed by men who did 
not wish to commit them, it was as if the main- 
spring of his life, on which everything de- 
pended and which made everything appear 
alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and 
everything had collapsed into a heap of mean- 
ingless rubbish. Though he did not acknowl- 
edge it to himself, his faith in the right order- 



55* 



WAR AND PEACE 



ing of the universe, in humanity, in his own 
soul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had 
experienced this before, but never so strongly 
as now. When similar doubts had assailed him 
before, they had been the result of his own 
wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he 
had felt that relief from his despair and from 
those doubts was to be found within himself. 
But now he felt that the universe had crumbled 
before his eyes and only meaningless ruins re- 
mained, and this not by any fault of his own. 
He felt that it was not in his power to regain 
faith in the meaning of life. 

Around him in the darkness men were stand- 
ing and evidently something about him inter- 
ested them greatly. They were telling him 
something and asking him something. Then 
they led him away somewhere, and at last he 
found himself in a corner of the shed among 
men who were laughing and talking on all 
sides. 

"Well, then, mates . . . that very prince who 
. . ." some voice at the other end of the shed 
was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word 
who. 

Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of 
straw against the wall, Pierre sometimes opened 
and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as 
he closed them he saw before him the dreadful 
face of the factory lad -especially dreadful be- 
cause of its simplicity and the faces of the 
murderers, even more dreadful because of 
their disquiet. And he opened his eyes again 
and stared vacantly into the darkness around 
him. 

Beside him in a stooping position sat a small 
man of whose presence he was first made aware 
by a strong smell of perspiration which came 
from him every time he moved. This man was 
doing something to his legs in the darkness, 
and though Pierre could not see his face he felt 
that the man continually glanced at him. On 
growing used to the darkness Pierre saw that 
the man was taking off his leg bands, and the 
way he did it aroused Pierre's interest. 

Having unwound the string that tied the 
band on one leg, he carefully coiled it up and 
immediately set to work on the other leg, 
glancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung 
up the first string the other was already un- 
winding the band on the second leg. In this 
way, having carefully removed the leg bands 
by deft circular motions of his arm following 
one another uninterruptedly, the man hung 
the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his 
bead* Then he took out a knife, cut something, 



closed the knife, placed it under the head of 
his bed, and, seating himself comfortably, 
clasped his arms round his lifted knees and 
fixed his eyes on Pierre. The latter was con- 
scious of something pleasant, comforting, and 
well rounded in these deft movements, in the 
man's well-ordered arrangements in his corner, 
and even in his very smell, and he looked at 
the man without taking his eyes from him. 

"You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?" the 
little man suddenly said. 

And there was so much kindliness and sim- 
plicity in his singsong voice that Pierre tried to 
reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears 
rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre 
no time to betray his confusion, instantly con- 
tinued in the same pleasant tones: 

"Eh, lad, don't fret!" said he, in the tender 
singsong caressing voice old Russian peasant 
women employ. "Don't fret, friend'suffer an 
hour, live for an age!' that's how it is, my dear 
fellow. And here we live, thank heaven, with- 
out offense. Among these folk, too, there are 
good men as well as bad," said he, and still 
speaking, he turned on his knees with a supple 
movement, got up, coughed, and went off to 
another part of the shed. 

"Eh, you rascal!" Pierre heard the same kind 
voice saying at the other end of the shed. "So 
you've come, you rascal? She remembers. . . . 
Now, now, that'll do!" 

And the soldier, pushing away a little dog 
that was jumping up at him, returned to his 
place and sat down. In his hands he had some- 
thing wrapped in a rag. 

"Here, eat a bit, sir," said he, resuming his 
former respectful tone as he unwrapped and 
offered Pierre some baked potatoes. "We had 
soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand!" 

Pierre had not eaten all day arid the smell of 
the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him. 
He thanked the soldier and began to eat. 

"Well, are they all right?" said the soldier 
with a smile. "You should do like this." 

He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, 
cut the potato into two equal halves on the 
palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it 
from the rag, and handed it to Pierre. 

"The potatoes are grandl" he said once 
more. "Eat some like that!" 

Pierre thought he had never eaten anything 
that tasted better. 

"Oh, I'm all right/' said he, "but why did 
they shoot those poor fellows? The last one 
was hardly twenty." 

"Tss, tt . . . 1" said the little man. "Ah, what 



BOOK TWELVE 



553' 



a sin ... what a sin!" he added quickly, and as 
if his words were always waiting ready in his 
mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: 
"How was it, sir, that you stayed in Moscow?" 

"I didn't think they would come so soon. I 
stayed accidentally," replied Pierre. 

"And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At 
your house?" 

"No, I went to look at the fire, and they 
arrested me there, and tried me as an incendi- 
ary." 

"Where there's law there's injustice," put in 
the little man. 

"And have you been here long?" Pierre asked 
as he munched the last of the potato. 

"I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of 
a hospital in Moscow." 

"Why, are you a soldier then?" 

"Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regi- 
ment. I was dying of fever. We weren't told 
anything. There were some twenty of us lying 
there. We had no idea, never guessed at all." 

"And do you feel sad here?" Pierre inquired. 

"How can one help it, lad? My name is Plat- 
on, and the surname is Karataev," he added, 
evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre 
to address him. "They call me 'little falcon' in 
the regiment. How is one to help feeling sad? 
Moscowshe's the mother of cities. How can 
one see all this and not feel sad? But 'the mag- 
got gnaws the cabbage, yet dies first'; that's 
what the old folks used to tell us," he added 
rapidly. 

"What? What did you say?" asked Pierre. 

"Who? I?" said Karataev. "I say things hap- 
pen not as we plan but as God judges," he re- 
plied, thinking that he was repeating what he 
had said before, and immediately continued: 

"Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? 
And a house? So you have abundance, then? 
And a housewife? And your old parents, are 
they still living?" he asked. 

And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, 
he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness 
puckered the soldier's lips as he put these 
questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had 
no parents, especially that he had no mother. 

"A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for wel- 
come, but there's none as dear as one's own 
mother 1" said he. "Well, and have you little 
ones?" he went on asking. 

Again Pierre's negative answer seemed to 
distress him, and he hastened to add: 

"Never mind! You're young folks yet, and 
please God may still have some. The great 
thine is to live in harmony. . . ." 



"But it's all the same now," Pierre could not 
help saying. 

"Ah, my dear fellow!" rejoined Karatdev, 
"never decline a prison or a beggar's sack!" 

He seated himself more comfortably and 
coughed, evidently preparing to tell a long 
story. 

"Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at 
home," he began. "We had a well-to-do home- 
stead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well 
and our house was one to thank God for. When 
Father and we went out mowing there were 
seven of us. We lived well. We were real peas- 
ants. It so happened . . ." 

And Platon Karatdev told a long story of 
how he had gone into someone's copse to take 
wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, 
had been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a 
soldier. 

"Well, lad," and a smile changed the tone of 
his voice, "we thought it was a misfortune but 
it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for 
my sin, my brother would have had to go as a 
soldier. But he, my younger brother, had five 
little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife 
behind. We had a little girl, but God took her 
before I went as a soldier. 1 come home on 
leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and 
see that they are living better than before. The 
yard full of cattle, the women at home, two 
brothers away earning wages, andonly Michael 
the youngest, at home. Father, he says, 'All my 
children are the same to me: it hurts the same 
whichever finger gets bitten. But if Plat6n 
hadn't been shaved for a soldier, Michael 
would have had to go.' He called us all to him 
and, will you believe it, placed us in front of 
the icons. 'Michael,' he says, 'come here and 
bow down to his feet; and you, young woman, 
you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, 
also bow down before him! Do you under- 
stand?' he says. That's how it is, dear fellow. 
Fate looks for a head. But we are always judg- 
ing, 'that's not wellthat's not right!' Our luck 
is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and 
it bulges, but when you've drawn it out it's 
empty! That's how it is." 

And Plat6n shifted his seat on the straw. 

After a short silence he rose. 

"Well, I think you must be sleepy," said he, 
and began rapidly crossing himself and repeat- 
ing: 

"Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, 
Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint 
Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, 
have mercv on us and save us I" he concluded, 



554 



WAR AND PEACE 



then bowed to the ground, got up, sighed, and 
sat down again on his heap of straw. "That's 
the way. Lay me down like a stone, O God, 
and raise me up like a loaf," he muttered as he 
lay down, pulling his coat over him. 

"What prayer was that you were saying?" 
asked Pierre. 

"Eh?" murmured Plat6n, who had almost 
fallen asleep. "What was I saying? I was pray- 
ing. Don't you pray?" 

"Yes, I do," said Pierre. "But what was that 
you said: Frola and Lavra?" 

"Well, of course," replied Plat6n quickly, 
"the horses' saints. One must pity the animals 
too. Eh, the rascal! Now you've curled up and 
got warm, you daughter of a bitch!" said Kara- 
tev, touching the dog that lay at his feet, and 
again turning over he fell asleep immediately. 

Sounds of crying and screaming came from 
somewhere in the distance outside, and flames 
were visible through the cracks of the shed, 
but inside it was quiet and dark. For a long 
time Pierre did not sleep, but lay with eyes 
open in the darkness, listening to the regular 
snoring of Plat6n who lay beside him, and he 
felt that the world that had been shattered was" 
once more stirring in his soul with a new 
beauty and on new and unshakable founda- 
tions. 

CHAPTER XIII 

TWENTY-THREE SOLDIERS, three officers, and 
two officials were confined in the shed in which 
Pierre had been placed and where he remained 
for four weeks. 

When Pierre remembered them afterwards 
they all seemed misty figures to him except 
Plat6n Karatdev, who always remained in his 
mind a most vivid and precious memory and 
the personification of everything Russian, 
kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neigh- 
bor next morning at dawn the first impression 
of him, as of something round, was fully con- 
firmed: Plat6n's whole figure in a French 
overcoat girdled with a cord, a soldier's cap, 
and bast shoes was round. His head was quite 
round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his 
arms, which he held as if ever ready to em- 
brace something, were rounded, his pleasant 
smile and his large, gentle brown eyes were 
also round. 

Plat6n Karataev must have been fifty, judg- 
ing by his stories of campaigns he had been in, 
told as by an old soldier. He did not himself 
know his age and was quite unable to deter- 
mine it. But his brilliantly white, strong teeth 



which showed in two unbroken semicircles 
when he laughed as he often did were all 
sound and good, there was not a gray hair in 
his beard or on his head, and his whole body 
gave an impression of suppleness and especial- 
ly of firmness and endurance. 

His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, 
had an expression of innocence and youth, his 
voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief 
peculiarity of his speech was its directness and 
appositeness. It was evident that he never con- 
sidered what he had said or was going to say, 
and consequently the rapidity and justice of 
his intonation had an irresistible persuasive- 
ness. 

His physical strength and agility during the 
first days of his imprisonment were such that 
he seemed not to know what fatigue and sick- 
ness meant. Every night before lying down, he 
said: "Lord, lay me down as a stone and raise 
me up as a loaf!" and every morning on get- 
ting up, he said: "I lay down and curled up, I 
get up and shake myself." And indeed he only 
had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and 
he only had to shake himself, to be ready with- 
out a moment's delay for some work, just as 
children are ready to play directly they awake. 
He could do everything, not very well but not 
badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and 
mended boots. He was always busy, and only 
at night allowed himself conversation of which 
he was fond and songs. He did not sing like a 
trained singer who knows he is listened to, but 
like the birds, evidently giving vent to the 
sounds in the same way that one stretches one- 
self or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and 
the sounds were always high-pitched, mourn- 
ful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his face 
at such times was very serious. 

Having been taken prisoner and allowed his 
beard to grow, he seemed to have thrown off 
all that had been forced upon him everything 
military and alien to himself and had returned 
to his former peasant habits. 

"A soldier on leave a shirt outside 
breeches," l he would say. 

He did not like talking about his life as a 
soldier, though he did not complain, and often 
mentioned that he had not been flogged once 
during the whole of his army service. When 
he related anything it was generally some old 
and evidently precious memory of his "Chris- 

1 The peasants wear their shirts fastened by a 
girdle at the waist and hanging loose outside their 
breeches, whereas a soldier's shirt is tucked inside. 
-TR. 



BOOK TWELVE 



555 



tian" life, as he called his peasant existence. 
The proverbs, of which his talk was full, were 
for the most part not the coarse and indecent 
saws soldiers employ, but those folk sayings 
which taken without a context seem so insig- 
nificant, but when used appositely suddenly ac- 
quire a significance of profound wisdom. 

He would often say the exact opposite of 
what he had said on a previous occasion, yet 
both would be right. He liked to talk and he 
talked well, adorning his speech with terms of 
endearment and with folk sayings which Pierre 
thought he invented himself, but the chief 
charm of his talk lay in the fact that the com- 
monest events sometimes just such as Pierre 
had witnessed without taking notice of them 
assumed in Karatdev's speech a character of 
solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales 
one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening 
(they were always the same), but most of all he 
liked to hear stories of real life. He would 
smile joyfully when listening to such stories, 
now and then putting in a word or asking a 
question to make the moral beauty of what he 
was told clear to himself. Karataev had no at- 
tachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre un- 
derstood them, but loved and lived affection- 
ately with everything life brought him in con- 
tact with, particularly with man not any par- 
ticular man, but those with whom he happened 
to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the 
French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but 
Pierre felt that in spite of Karataev's affection- 
ate tenderness for him (by which he uncon- 
sciously gave Pierre's spiritual life its due) he 
would not have grieved for a moment at part- 
ing from him. And Pierre began to feel in the 
same way toward Karataev. 

To all the other prisoners Plat6n Karataev 
seemed a most ordinary soldier. They called 
him "little falcon" or "Plat6sha," chaffed him 
good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But 
to Pierre he always remained what he had 
seemed that first night: an unfathomable, 
rounded, eternal personification of the spirit 
of simplicity and truth. 

Plat6n Karataev knew nothing by heart ex- 
cept his prayers. When he began to speak he 
seemed not to know how he would conclude. 

Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of 
his words, would ask him to repeat them, but 
Plat6n could never recall what he had said a 
moment before, just as he never could repeat 
to Pierre the words of his favorite song: native 
and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in 
it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning 



could be got out of it. He did not, and could 
not, understand the meaning of words apart 
from their context. Every word and action of 
his was the manifestation of an activity un- 
known to him, which was his life. But his life, 
as he regarded it, had no meaning as a sepa- 
rate thing. It had meaning only as part of a 
whole of which he was always conscious. His 
words and actions flowed from him as evenly, 
inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance ex- 
hales from a flower. He could not understand 
the value or significance of any word or deed 
taken separately. 

CHAPTER XIV 

WHEN PRINCESS MARY heard from Nicholas 
that her brother was with the Rost6vs at Yaro- 
slavl she at once prepared to go there, in spite 
of her aunt's efforts to dissuade her and not 
merely to go herself but to take her nephew 
with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, pos- 
sible or impossible, she did not ask and did 
not want to know: it was her duty not only 
herself to be near her brother who was perhaps 
dying, but to do everything possible to take his 
son to him, and so she prepared to set off. That 
she had not heard from Prince Andrew him- 
self, Princess Mary attributed to his being too 
weak to write or to his considering the long 
journey too hard and too dangerous for her 
and his son. 

In a few days Princess Mary was ready to 
start. Her equipages were the huge family 
coach in which she had traveled to Voronezh, a 
semiopen trap, and a baggage cart. With her 
traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne, little Nich- 
olas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, 
Tikhon, and a young footman and courier her 
aunt had sent to accompany her. 

The usual route through Moscow could not 
be thought of, and the roundabout way Prin- 
cess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk, 
Ryazan, Vladimir, and Shuya was very long 
and, as post horses were not everywhere ob- 
tainable, very difficult, and near Ryazan where 
the French were said to have shown themselves 
was even dangerous. 

During this difficult journey Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, Dessalles, and Princess Mary's serv- 
ants were astonished at her energy and firmness 
of spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier 
than any of them, and no difficulties daunted 
her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which 
infected her fellow travelers, they approached 
Yaroslavl by the end of the second week. 

The last days of her stay in Vor6nezh had 



55 6 

been the happiest of her life. Her love for Ros- 
t6v no longer tormented or agitated her. It 
filled her whole soul, had become an integral 
part of herself, and she no longer struggled 
against it. Latterly she had become convinced 
that she loved and was beloved, though she 
never said this definitely to herself in words. 
She had become convinced of it at her last in- 
terview with Nicholas, when he had come to 
tell her that her brother was with the Rostovs. 
Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to 
the fact that Prince Andrew's relations with 
Natdsha might, if he recovered, be renewed, 
but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew 
and thought of this. 

Yet in spite of that, his relation to her con- 
siderate, delicate, and loving not only re- 
mained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed 
to Princess Mary that he was even glad that 
the family connection between them allowed 
him to express his friendship more freely. She 
knew that she loved for the first and only 
time in her life and felt that she was beloved, 
and was happy in regard to it. 

But this happiness on one side of her spir- 
itual nature did not prevent her feeling grief 
for her brother with full force; on the contrary, 
that spiritual tranquillity on the one side made 
it the more possible for her to give full play to 
her feeling for her brother. That feeling was 
so strong at the moment of leaving Voronezh 
that those who saw her off, as they looked at 
her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she 
would fall ill on the journey. But the very dif- 
ficulties and preoccupations of the journey, 
which she took so actively in hand, saved her 
fora while from her grief and gave her strength. 

As always happens when traveling, Princess 
Mary thought only of the journey itself, for- 
getting its object. But as she approached Yaro- 
slavl the thought of what might await her 
there not after many days, but that very eve- 
ningagain presented itself to her and her agi- 
tation increased to its utmost limit. 

The courier who had been sent on in ad- 
vance to find out where the Rost6vs were stay- 
ing in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince 
Andrew was, when he met the big coach just 
entering the town gates was appalled by the 
terrible pallor of the princess* face that looked 
out at him from the window. 

"I have found out everything, your excel- 
lency: the Rost6vs are staying at the merchant 
Brdnnikov's house, in the Square not far 
from here, right above the V61ga," said the 
courier. 



WAR AND PEACE 

Princess Mary looked at him with frightened 
inquiry, not understanding why he did not 
reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how 
was her brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put 
that question for her. 

"How is the prince?" she asked. 

"His excellency is staying in the same house 
with them." 

"Then he is alive," thought Princess Mary, 
and asked in a low voice: "How is he?" 

"The servants say he is still the same." 

What "still the same" might mean Princess 
Mary did not ask, but with an unnoticed glance 
at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sit- 
ting in front of her looking with pleasure at the 
town, she bowed her head and did not raise it 
again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking, 
and swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps 
clattered as they were let down. 

The carriage door was opened. On the left 
there was water a great river and on the right 
a porch. There were people at the entrance: 
servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of 
black hair, smiling as it seemed to Princess 
Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This 
was S6nya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. 
"This way, this wayl" said the girl, with the 
same artificial smile, and the princess found 
herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of 
Oriental type, who came rapidly to meet her 
with a look of emotion. This was the countess. 
She embraced Princess Mary and kissed her. 

"Mon enfant!" she muttered, "je vous aime 
et vous connais depuis longtemps." * 

Despite her excitement, Princess Mary re- 
alized that this was the countess and that it was 
necessary to say something to her. Hardly 
knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter 
a few polite phrases in French in the same tone 
as those that had been addressed to her, and 
asked: "How is he?" 

"The doctor says that he is not in danger," 
said the countess, but as she spoke she raised 
her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed 
a contradiction of her words. 

"Where is he? Can I see him can I?" asked 
the princess. 

"One moment, Princess, one moment, my 
dearl Is this his son?" said the countess, turn- 
ing to little Nicholas who was coming in 
with Dessalles. "There will be room for every- 
body, this is a big house. Oh, what a lovely 
boy!" 

The countess took Princess Mary into the 

1 "My childl I love you and have known you a 
long time." 



BOOK TWELVE 

drawing room, where S6nya was talking to 
Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess ca- 
ressed the boy, and the old count came in and 
welcomed the princess. He had changed very 
much since Princess Mary had last seen him. 
Then he had been a brisk, cheerful, self-assured 
old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered 
person. While talking to Princess Mary he con- 
tinually looked round as if asking everyone 
whether he was doing the right thing. After 
the destruction of Moscow and of his property, 
thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed 
to have lost the sense of his own significance and 
to feel that there was no longer a place for him 
in life. 

In spite of her one desire to see her brother 
as soon as possible, and her vexation that at 
the moment when all she wanted was to see 
him they should be trying to entertain her and 
pretending to admire her nephew, the princess 
noticed all that was going on around her and 
felt the necessity of submitting, for a time, to 
this new order of things which she had entered. 
She knew it to be necessary, and though it was 
hard for her she was not vexed with these peo- 
pie. 

"This is my niece," said the count, intro- 
ducing S6nya "You don't know her, Princess?" 

Princess Mary turned to S6nya and, trying 
to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her 
toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt op- 
pressed by the fact that the mood of everyone 
around her was so far from what was in her 
own heart. 

"Where is he?" she asked again, addressing 
them all. 

"He is downstairs. Natasha is with him," 
answered S6nya, flushing. "We have sent to 
ask. I think you must be tired, Princess." 

Tears of vexation showed themselves in 
Princess Mary's eyes. She turned away and was 
about to ask the countess again how to go to 
him, when light, impetuous, and seemingly 
buoyant steps were heard at the door. The 
princess looked round and saw Natdsha coming 
in, almost running that Natasha whom she 
had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow 
long since. 

But hardly had the princess looked at Na- 
tdsha's face before she realized that here was 
a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a 
friend. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and 
began to cry on her shoulder. 

As soon as Natdsha, sitting at the head of 
Prince Andrew's bed, heard of Princess Mary's 
arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to 



557 

her with those swift steps that had sounded 
buoyant to Princess Mary. 

There was only one expression on her agitat- 
ed face when she ran into the drawing room- 
that of love boundless love for him, for her, 
and for all that was near to the man she loved; 
and of pity, suffering for others, and passion- 
ate desire to give herself entirely to helping 
them. It was plain that at that moment there 
was in Natasha's heart no thought of herself 
or of her own relations with Prince Andrew. 

Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, 
understood all this at the first glance at Nata- 
sha's face, and wept on her shoulder with sor- 
rowful pleasure. 

"Come, come to him, Mary," said Natdsha, 
leading her into the other room. 

Princess Mary raised her head, dried her 
eyes, and turned to Natdsha. She felt that from 
her she would be able to understand and learn 
everything. 

"How . . ." she began her question but 
stopped short. 

She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to 
answer, in words. Natasha's face and eyes would 
have to tell her all more clearly and profound- 



Natdsha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid 
and in doubt whether to say all she knew or 
not; she seemed to feel that before those lumi- 
nous eyes which penetrated into the very 
depths of her heart, it was impossible not to 
tell the whole truth which she saw. And sud- 
denly, Natdsha's lips twitched, ugly wrinkles 
gathered round her mouth, and covering her 
face with her hands she burst into sobs. 

Princess Mary understood. 

But she still hoped, and asked, in words she 
herself did not trust: 

"But how is his wound? What is his general 
condition?" 

"You, you . . . will see," was all Natasha 
could say. 

They sat a little while downstairs near his 
room till they had left off crying and were able 
to go to him with calm faces. 

"How has his whole illness gone? Is it long 
since he grew worse? When did this happen?" 
Princess Mary inquired. 

Natdsha told her that at first there had been 
danger from his feverish condition and the 
pain he suffered, but at Tr6itsa that had passed 
and the doctor had only been afraid of gan- 
grene. That danger had also passed. When 
they reached Yarosldvl the wound had begun 
to fester (Natdsha knew all about such things 



WAR AND PEACE 



as festering) and the doctor had said that the 
festering might take a normal course. Then fe- 
ver set in, but the doctor had said the fever was 
not very serious. 

"But two days ago this suddenly happened," 
said Natdsha, struggling with her sobs. "I don't 
know why, but you will see what he is like." 

"Is he weaker? Thinner?" asked the princess. 

"No, it's not that, but worse. You will see. 
O, Mary, he is too good, he cannot, cannot live, 
because . . ." 

CHAPTER XV 

WHEN NATASHA opened Prince Andrew's door 
with a familiar movement and let Princess 
Mary pass into the room before her, the prin- 
cess felt the sobs rising in her throat. Hard as 
she had tried to prepare herself, and now tried 
to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be 
unable to look at him without tears. 

The princess understood what Natasha had 
meant by the words: "two clays ago this sudden- 
ly happened." She understood those words to 
mean that he had suddenly softened and that 
this softening and gentleness were signs of ap- 
proaching death. As she stepped to the door 
she already saw in imagination Andrew's face 
as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle, 
mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely 
shown, and which therefore affected her very 
strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, 
tender words to her such as her father had ut- 
tered before his death, and that she would not 
be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in 
his presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, 
and she went in. The sobs rose higher and 
higher in her throat as she more and more 
clearly distinguished his form and her short- 
sighted eyes tried to make out his features, and 
then she saw his face and met his gaze. 

He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown 
on a divan, surrounded by pillows. He was 
thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white 
hand he held a handkerchief, while with the 
other he stroked the delicate mustache he had 
grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes 
gazed at them as they entered. 

On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Prin- 
cess Mary's pace suddenly slackened, she felt 
her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She sud- 
denly felt guilty and grew timid on catching 
the expression of his face and eyes. 

"But in what am I to blame?" she asked her- 
self. And his cold, stern look replied: "Because 
you are alive and thinking of the living, while 
I ..." 



In the deep gaze that seemed to look not out- 
wards but inwards there was an almost hostile 
expression as he slowly regarded his sister and 
Natdsha. 

He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his 
as was their wont. 

"How are you, Mary? How did you manage 
to get here?" said he in a voice as calm and 
aloof as his look. 

Had he screamed in agony, that scream 
would not have struck such horror into Prin- 
cess Mary's heart as the tone of his voice. 

"And have you brought little Nicholas?" he 
asked in the same slow, quiet manner and with 
an obvious effort to remember. 

"How are you now?" said Princess Mary, 
herself surprised at what she was saying. 

"That, my dear, you must ask the doctor," 
he replied, and again making an evident effort 
to be affectionate, he said with his lips only 
(his words clearly did not correspond to his 
thoughts): 

"Merci, chere amie, d'etre venue." l 

Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pres- 
sure made him wince just perceptibly. He was 
silent, and she did not know what to say. She 
now understood what had happened to him 
two days before. In his words, his tone, and 
especially in that calm, almost antagonistic 
look could be felt an estrangement from every- 
thing belonging to this world, terrible in one 
who is alive. Evidently only with an effort 
did he understand anything living; but it 
was obvious that he failed to understand, 
not because he lacked the power to do so 
but because he understood something else- 
something the living did not and could not 
understand and which wholly occupied his 
mind. 

"There, you see how strangely fate has 
brought us together," said he, breaking the si- 
lence and pointing to Natasha. "She looks aft- 
er me all the time." 

Princess Mary heard him and did not under- 
stand how he could say such a thing. He, the 
sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he 
say that, before her whom he loved and who 
loved him? Had he expected to live he could 
not have said those words in that offensively 
cold tone. If he had not known that he was 
dying, how could he have failed to pity her and 
how could he speak like that in her presence? 
The only explanation was that he was indiffer- 
ent, because something else, much more im- 
portant, had been revealed to him. 

1 "Thank you for coming, my dear." 



BOOK TWELVE 



559 



The conversation was cold and disconnect- 
ed and continually broke off. 

"Mary came by way of Ryazdn," said Nata- 
sha. 

Prince Andrew did not notice that she called 
his sister Mary, and only after calling her so in 
his presence did Natisha notice it herself. 

"Really?" he asked. 

"They told her that all Moscow has been 
burned down, and that . . ." 

Natasha stopped. It was impossible to talk. 
It was plain that he was making an effort to lis- 
ten, but could not do so. 

"Yes, they say it's burned," he said. "It's a 
great pity," and he gazed straight before him, 
absently stroking his mustache with his fingers. 

"And so you have met Count Nicholas, 
Mary?" Prince Andrew suddenly said, evident- 
ly wishing to speak pleasantly to them. "He 
wrote here that he took a great liking to you," 
he went on simply and calmly, evidently un- 
able to understand all the complex significance 
his words had for living people. "If you liked 
him too, it would be a good thing for you to 
get married," he added rather more quickly, 
as if pleased at having found words he had 
long been seeking. 

Princess Mary heard his words but they had 
no meaning for her, except as a proof of how 
far away he now was from everything living. 

"Why talk of me?" she said quietly and 
glanced at Natasha. 

Nat&amp;sha, who felt her glance, did not look 
at her. All three were again silent. 

"Andrew, would you like . . ." Princess Mary 
suddenly said in a trembling voice, "would you 
like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking 
about you!" 

Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and 
for the first time, but Princess Mary, who knew 
his face so well, saw with horror that he did not 
smile with pleasure or affection for his son, 
but with quiet, gentle irony because he thought 
she was trying what she believed to be the last 
means of arousing him. 

"Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he 
quite well?" 

When little Nicholas was brought in to Prince 
Andrew's room he looked at his father with 
frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one 
else was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and 
evidently did not know what to say to him. 

When Nicholas had been led away, Princess 
Mary again went up to her brother, kissed him, 
and unable to restrain her tears any longer 
began to cry. 



He looked at her attentively. 

"Is it about Nicholas?" he asked. 

Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping. 

"Mary, you know the Gosp . . ." but he 
broke off. 

"What did you say?" 

"Nothing. You mustn't cry here," he said, 
looking at her with the same cold expression. 

When Princess Mary began to cry, he under- 
stood that she was crying at the thought that 
little Nicholas would be left without a father. 
With a great effort he tried toreturn to lifeand 
to see things from their point of view. 

"Yes, to them it must seem sadl" he thought. 
"But how simple it is. 

"The fowls of the air sow not, neither do 
they reap, yet your Father feedeth them," he 
said to himself and wished to say to Princess 
Mary; "but no, they will take it their own way, 
they won't understand! They can't understand 
that all those feelings they prize so all our 
feelings, all those ideas that seem so important 
to us, are unnecessary. We cannot understand 
one another," and he remained silent. 

Prince Andrew's little son was seven. He 
could scarcely read, and knew nothing. After 
that day he lived through many things, gaining 
knowledge, observation, and experience, but 
had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards 
acquired, he could not have had a better or 
more profound understanding of the meaning 
of the scene he had witnessed between his fa- 
ther, Mary, and Natasha, than he had then. He 
understood it completely, and, leaving the room 
without crying, went silently up to Natdsha 
who had come out with him and looked shyly 
at her with his beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then 
his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled and lean- 
ing his head against her he began to cry. 

After that he avoided Dessalles and the 
countess who caressed him and either sat alone 
or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Na- 
tAsha of whom he seemed even fonder than 
of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and 
shyly. 

When Princess Mary had left Prince An- 
drew she fully understood what Natdsha's face 
had told her. She did not speak any more to 
Natdsha of hopes of saving his life. She took 
turns with her beside his sofa, and did not cry 
any more, but prayed continually, turning in 
soul to that Eternal and Unfathomable, whose 
presence above the dying man was now so evi- 
dent.

CHAPTER XVI 

NOT ONLY did Prince Andrew know he would 
die, but he felt that he was dying and was al- 
ready half dead. He was conscious of an aloof- 
ness from everything earthly and a strange and 
joyous lightness of existence. Without haste 
or agitation he awaited what was coming. That 
inexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown 
the presence of which he had felt continually 
all his life was now near to him and, by the 
strange lightness he experienced, almost com- 
prehensible and palpable. . . . 

Formerly he had feared the end. He had 
twice experienced that terribly tormenting 
fear of death the end but now he no longer 
understood that fear. 

He had felt it for the first time when the 
shell spun like a top before him, and he looked 
at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and 
knew that he was face to face with death. When 
he came to himself after being wounded and 
the flower of eternal, unfettered love had in- 
stantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed 
from the bondage of life that had restrained it, 
he no longer feared death and ceased to think 
about it. 

During the hours of solitude, suffering, and 
partial delirium he spent after he was wound- 
ed, the more deeply he penetrated into the 
new principle of eternal love revealed to him, 
the more he unconsciously detached himself 
from earthly life. To love everything and ev- 
erybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love 
meant not to love anyone, not to live this earth- 
ly life. And the more imbued he became with 
that principle of love, the more he renounced 
life and the more completely he destroyed that 
dreadful barrier which in the absence of such 
love stands between life and death. When 
during those first days he remembered that he 
would have to die, he said to himself: "Well, 
what of it? So much the better!" 

But after the night in Mytishchi when, half 
delirious, he had seen her for whom he longed 
appear before him and, having pressed her 
hand to his lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, 
love for a particular woman again crept un- 
observed into his heart and once more bound 
him to life. And joyful and agitating thoughts 
began to occupy his mind. Recalling the mo- 
ment at the ambulance station when he had 
seen KurAgin, he could not now regain the 
feeling he then had, but was tormented by the 
question whether Kurdgin was alive. And he 
dared not inquire. 



WAR AND PEACE 

His illness pursued its normal physical 
course, but what Natdsha referred to when she 
said: "This suddenly happened," had occurred 
two days before Princess Mary arrived. It was 
the last spiritual struggle between life and 
death, in which death gained the victory. It 
was the unexpected realization of the fact that 
he still valued life as presented to him in the 
form of his love for Natdsha, and a last, though 
ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before 
the unknown. 

It was evening. As usual after dinner he was 
slightly feverish, and his thoughts were pre- 
ternaturally clear. S6nya was sitting by the 
table. He began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of 
happiness seized him. 

"Ah, she has come!" thought he. 

And so it was: in S6nya's place sat Natasha 
who had just come in noiselessly. 

Since she had begun looking after him, he had 
always experienced this physical consciousness 
of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair 
placed sideways, screening the light of the can- 
dle from him, and was knitting a stocking. 
She had learned to knit stockings since Prince 
Andrew had casually mentioned that no one 
nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit 
stockings, and that there is something soothing 
in the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked 
lightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, 
and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile 
of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball 
rolled off her knees. She started, glanced round 
at him, and screening the candle with her hand 
stooped carefully with a supple and exact 
movement, picked up the ball, and regained 
her former position. 

He looked at her without moving and saw 
that she wanted to draw a deep breath after 
stooping, but refrained from doing so and 
breathed cautiously. 

At the Troitsa monastery they had spoken 
of the past, and he had told her that if he 
lived he would always thank God for his 
wound which had brought them together 
again, but after that they never spoke of the 
future. 

"Can it or can it not be?" he now thought 
as he looked at her and listened to the light 
click of the steel needles. "Can fate have 
brought me to her so strangely only for me to 
die? ... Is it possible that the truth of life has 
been revealed to me only to show me that I 
have spent my life in falsity? I love her more 
than anything in the world! But what am I to 
do if I love her?" he thought, and he involun- 



BOOK TWELVE 

tarily groaned, from a/iabit acquired during 
his sufferings. 

On hearing that sound Natdsha put down 
the stocking, leaned nearer to him, and sud- 
denly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped light- 
ly up to him and bent over him. 

"You are not asleep?" 

"No, I have been looking at you a long time. 
I felt you come in. No one else gives me that 
sense of soft tranquillity that you do ... that 
light. I want to weep for joy." 

Natdsha drew closer to him. Her face shone 
with rapturous joy. 

"Natdsha, I love you too muchl More than 
anything in the world." 

"And I!" She turned away for an instant. 
"Why too much?" she asked. 

"Why too much? . , . Well, what do you 
think, what do you feel in your soul, your 
whole soul shall I live? What do you think?" 

"I am sureof it, surel" Natdsha almost shout- 
ed, taking hold of both his hands with a pas- 
sionate movement. 

He remained silent awhile. 

"How good it would be!" and taking her 
hand he kissed it. 

Natasha felt happy and agitated, but at 
once remembered that this would not do and 
that he had to be quiet. 

"But you have not slept," she said, repress- 
ing her joy. "Try to sleep . . . please!" 

He pressed her hand and released it, and 
she went back to the candleand sat down again 
in her former position. Twice she turned and 
looked at him, and her eyes met his beaming 
at her. She set herself a task on her stocking 
and resolved not to turn round till it was fin- 
ished. 

Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. 
He did not sleep long and suddenly awoke 
with a start and in a cold perspiration. 

As he fell asleep he had still been thinking 
of the subject that now always occupied his 
mind about life and death, and chiefly about 
death. He felt himself nearer to it. 

"Love? What is love?" he thought. 

"Love hinders death. Love is life. All, every- 
thing that I understand, I understand only 
because I love. Everything is, everything ex- 
ists, only because 1 love. Everything is united 
by it alone. Love is God, and to die means that 
I, a particle of love, shall return to the general 
and eternal source." These thoughts seemed to 
him comforting. But they were only thoughts. 
Something was lacking in them, they were not 
clear, they were too one-sidedly personal and 



561 

brain-spun. And there was the former agita- 
tion and obscurity. He fell asleep. 

He dreamed that he was lying in the room he 
really was in, but that hewas quite well and un- 
wounded. Many various, indifferent, and insig- 
nificant people appeared before him. He talked 
to them and discussed something trivial. They 
were preparing to go away somewhere. Prince 
Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial 
and that he had more important cares, but he 
continued to speak, surprising them by empty 
witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these per- 
sons began to disappear and a single question, 
that of the closed door, superseded all else. He 
rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. 
Everything depended on whether he was, or 
was not, in time to lock it. He went, and tried 
to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he 
knew he would not be in time to lock the door 
though he painfullystrained all his powers. He 
was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear 
was the fear of death. It stood behind the door. 
But just when he was clumsily creeping to- 
ward the door, that dreadful something on the 
other side was already pressing against it 
and forcing its way in. Something not hu- 
mandeathwas breaking in through that 
door, and had to be kept out. He seized the 
door, making a final effort to hold it back to 
lock it was no longer possible but his efforts 
were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed 
from behind by that terror, opened and closed 
again. 

Once again it pushed from outside. His last 
superhuman efforts were vain and both halves 
of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and 
it was death, and Prince Andrew died. 

But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew re- 
membered that he was asleep, and at the very 
instant he died, having made an effort, he 
awoke. 

"Yes, it was death! I died and woke up. 
Yes, death is an awakening!" And all at once it 
grew light in his soul and the veil that had till 
then concealed the unknown was lifted from 
his spiritual vision. He felt as if powers till 
then confined within him had been liberated, 
and that strange lightness did not again leave 
him. 

When, waking in a cold perspiration, he 
moved on the divan, Natdsha went up and 
asked him what was the matter. He did not 
answer and looked at her strangely, not under- 
standing. 

That was what had happened to him two 
days before Princess Mary's arrival. From that 



56* 

day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting 
fever assumed a malignant character, but what 
the doctor said did not interest Natasha, she 
saw the terrible moral symptoms which to 
her were more convincing. 

From that day an awakening from life came 
to Prince Andrew together with his awakening 
from sleep. And compared to the duration of 
life it did not seem to him slower than an 
awakening from sleep compared to the dura- 
tion of a dream. 

There was nothing terrible or violent in this 
comparatively slow awakening. 

His last days and hours passed in an ordinary 
and simple way. Both Princess Mary and Na- 
tdsha, who did not leave him, felt this. They 
did not weep or shudder and during these last 
days they themselves felt that they were not 
attending on him (he was no longer there, he 
had left them) but on what reminded them 
most closely of him his body. Both felt this so 
strongly that the outward and terrible side of 
death did not affect them and they did not feel 
it necessary to foment their grief. Neither in his 
presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did 
they ever talk to one another about him. They 
felt that they could not express in words what 
they understood. 

They both saw that he was sinking slowly 
and quietly, deeper and deeper, away from 
them, and they both knew that this had to be 
so and that it was right. 

He confessed, and received communion: ev- 
eryone came to take leave of him. When they 
brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to 



WAR AND PEACE 

the boy's and turnec|taway, not because he 
felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and Nat- 
sha understood that) but simply because he 
thought it was all that was required of him, 
but when they told him to bless the boy, he did 
what was demanded and looked round as if 
asking whether there was anything else he 
should do. 

When the last convulsions of the body, which 
the spirit was leaving, occurred, Princess Mary 
and Natdsha were present. 

"Is it over?" said Princess Mary when his 
body had for a few minutes lain motionless, 
growing cold before them. Natdsha went up, 
looked at the dead eyes, and hastened to close 
them. She closed them but did not kiss them, 
but clung to that which reminded her most 
nearly of him his body. 

"Where has he gone? Where is he now? . . ." 

When the body, washed and dressed, lay in 
the coffin on a table, everyone came to take 
leave of him and they all wept. 

Little Nicholas cried because his heart was 
rent by painful perplexity. The countess and 
S6nya cried from pity for Natasha and because 
he was no more. The old count cried because 
he felt that before long, he, too, must take the 
same terrible step. 

Natdsha and Princess Mary also wept now, 
but not because of their own personal grief; 
they wept with a reverent and softening emo- 
tion which had taken possession of their souls 
at the consciousness of the simple and solemn 
mystery of death that had been accomplished 
in their presence. 



Book Thirteen: 1812 



CHAPTER I 

MAN'S MIND cannot grasp the causes of events 
in their completeness, but the desire to find 
those causes is implanted in man's soul. And 
without considering the multiplicity and com- 
plexity of the conditions any one of which 
taken separately may seem to be the cause, he 
snatches at the first approximation to a cause 
that seems to him intelligible and says: "This 
is the cause!" In historical events (where the 
actions of men are the subject of observation) 
the first and most primitive approximation to 
present itself was the will of the gods and, aft- 
er that, the will of those who stood in the most 
prominent position the heroes of history. But 
we need only penetrate to the essence of any 
historic event which lies in the activity of the 
general mass of men who take part in it to be 
convinced that the will of the historic hero 
does not control the actions of the mass but is 
itself continually controlled. It may seem to 
be a matter of indifference whether we under- 
stand die meaning of historical events this 
way or that; yet there is the same difference 
between a man who says that the people of the 
West moved on the East because Napoleon 
wished it and a man who says that this hap- 
pened because it had to happen, as there is be- 
tween those who declared that the earth was 
stationary and that the planets moved round 
it and those who admitted that they did not 
know what upheld the earth, but knew there 
were laws directing its movement and that of 
the other planets. There is, and can be, no 
cause of an historical event except the one 
cause of all causes. But there are laws direct- 
ing events, and some of these laws are known 
to us while we are conscious of others we can- 
not comprehend. The discovery of these laws 
is only possible when we have quite abandoned 
the attempt to find the cause in the will of 
some one man, just as the discovery of the laws 
of the motion of the planets was possible only 
when men abandoned the conception of the 
fixity of the earth. 



The historians consider that, next to the 
battle of Borodin6 and the occupation of Mos- 
cow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, 
th'e most important episode of the war of 1812 
was the movement of the Russian army from 
the Ryazan to the Kaluga road and to the 
Tarutino camp the so-called flank march 
across the Krdsnaya Fakhra River. They as- 
cribe the glory of that achievement of genius 
to different men and dispute as to whom the 
honor is due. Even foreign historians, includ- 
ing the French, acknowledge the genius of the 
Russian commanders when they speak of that 
Rank march. But it is hard to understand why 
military writers, and following them others, 
consider this flank march to be the profound 
conception of some one man who saved Rus- 
sia and destroyed Napoleon. In the first place 
it is hard to understand where the profundity 
and genius of this movement lay, for not much 
mental effort was needed to see that the best 
position for an army when it is not being at- 
tacked is where there are most provisions; and 
even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed 
that the best position for an army after its re- 
treat from Moscow in 1812 was on the Kaluga 
road. So it is impossible to understand by what 
reasoning the historians reach the conclusion 
that this maneuver was a profound one. And 
it is even more difficult to understand just why 
they think that this maneuver was calculated 
to save Russia and destroy the French; for this 
flank march, had it been preceded, accom- 
panied, or followed by other circumstances, 
might have proved ruinous to the Russians 
and salutary for the French. If the position of 
the Russian army really began to improve 
from the time of that march, it does not at all 
follow that the march was the cause of it. 

That flank march might not only have failed 
to give any advantage to the Russian army, 
but might in other circumstances have led to 
its destruction. What would have happened 
had Moscow not burned down? If Murat had 
not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had 



563 



564 



not remained inactive? If the Russian army at 
Krasnaya Fakhra had given battle as Berinig- 
sen and Barclay advised? What would have 
happened had the French attacked the Rus- 
sians while they were marching beyond the 
Fakhra? What would have happened if on ap- 
proaching Tarutino, Napoleon had attacked 
the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he 
had shown when he attacked them at Smo- 
le*nsk? What would have happened had the 
French moved on Petersburg? ... In any of 
these eventualities the flank march that brought 
salvation might have proved disastrous. 

The third and most incomprehensible thing 
is that people studying history deliberately 
avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be 
attributed to any one man, that no one ever 
foresaw it, and that in reality, like the retreat 
from Fill, it did not suggest itself to anyone in 
its entirety, but resultedmoment by moment, 
step by step, event by event from an endless 
number of most diverse circumstances and was 
only seen in its entirety when it had been ac- 
complished and belonged to the past. 

At the council at Fili the prevailing thought 
in the minds of the Russian commanders was 
the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a 
direct retreat by the Nizhni road. In proof of 
this there is the fact that the majority of the 
council voted for such a retreat, and above all 
there is the well-known conversation after the 
council, between the commander in chief and 
Lansk6y, who was in charge of the commissa- 
riat department. Lanskoy informed the com- 
mander in chief that the army supplies were 
for the most part stored along the Oka in the 
Tula and Ryazan provinces, and that if they re- 
treated on Nizhni the army would be separated 
from its supplies by the broad river Oka, which 
cannot be crossed early in winter. This was the 
first indication of the necessity of deviating 
from what had previously seemed the most 
natural course a direct retreat on Nizhni- 
N6vgorod.The army turned more to the south, 
along the Ryazan road and nearer to its sup- 
plies. Subsequently the inactivity of the French 
(who even lost sight of the Russian army), con- 
cern for the safety of the arsenal at Tula, and 
especially the advantages of drawing nearer to 
its supplies caused thearmy to turn still further 
south to the Tula road. Having crossed over, 
by a forced march, to the Tula road beyond the 
Fakhra, the Russian commanders intended to 
remain at Podolsk and had no thought of the 
Tartitino position; but innumerable circum- 
stances and the reappearance of French troops 



WAR AND PEACE 

who had for a time lost touch with the Rus- 
sians, and projects of giving battle, and above 
all the abundance of provisions in Kaluga 
province, obliged our army to turn still more 
to the south and to cross from the Tula to the 
Kaluga road and go toTariitino, which was be- 
tween the roads along which those supplies 
lay. Just as it is impossible to say when it was 
decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible 
to say precisely when, or by whom, it was de- 
cided to move to Tarutino. Only when the 
army had got there, as the result of innumer- 
able and varying forces, did people begin to 
assure themselves that they had desired this 
movement and long ago foreseen its result. 



CHAPTER II 

THE FAMOUS FLANK MOVEMENT merely consist- 
ed in this: after the advance of the French had 
ceased, the Russian army, which had been con- 
tinually retreating straight back from the in- 
vaders, deviated from that direct course and, 
not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn 
toward the district where supplies were abun- 
dant. 

If instead of imagining to ourselves com- 
manders of genius leading the Russian army, 
we picture that army without any leaders, it 
could not have done anything but make a re- 
turn movement toward Moscow, describing 
an arc in the direction where most provisions 
were to be found and where the country was 
richest. 

That movement from the Nizhni to the Ry- 
azdn, Tula, and Kaluga roads was so natural 
that even the Russian marauders moved in that 
direction, and demands were sent from Peters- 
burg for Kutuzov to take his army that way. 
At Tarutino Kutuzov received what was almost 
a reprimand from the Emperor for having 
moved his army along the Ryazan road, and the 
Emperor's letter indicated to him the very po- 
sition he had already occupied near Kaluga. 

Having rolled like a ball in the direction of 
the impetus given by the whole campaign and 
by the battle of Borodin6, the Russian army 
when the strength of that impetus was exhaust- 
ed and no fresh push was received assumed 
the position natural to it. 

Kutuzov's merit lay, not in any strategic ma- 
neuver of genius, as it is called, but in the fact 
that he alone understood the significance of 
what had happened. He alone then understood 
the meaning of the French army's inactivity, 
he alone continued to assert that the battle of 
Borodin6 had been a victory, he alone who as 



commander in chief might have been expected 
to be eager to attack employed his whole 
strength to restrain the Russian army from use- 
less engagements. 

The beast wounded at Borodin6 was lying 
where the fleeing hunter had left him; but 
whether he was still alive, whether he was 
strong and merely lying low, the hunter did 
not know. Suddenly the beast was heard to 
moan. 

The moan of that wounded beast (the 
French army) which betrayed its calamitous 
condition was the sending of Lauriston to Ku- 
tuzov's camp with overtures for peace. 

Napoleon, with his usual assurance that 
whatever entered his head was right, wrote to 
Kutuzov the first words that occurred to him, 
though they were meaningless. 

MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending 
one of my adjutants-general to discuss several in- 
teresting questions with you. I beg your Highness 
to credit what he says to you, especially when he 
expresses the sentiment of esteem and special re- 
gard I have long entertained for your person. This 
letter having no other object, I pray God t mon- 
sieur le prince Koutouzov f to keep you in His holy 
and gracious protection! NAPOLEON 

Moscow, October 30, 1812 

Kutuzov replied: "I should be cursed by pos- 
terity were I looked on as the initiator of a 
settlement of any sort. Such is the present 
spirit of my nation." But he continued to exert 
all his powers to restrain his troops from at- 
tacking. 

During the month that the French troops 
were pillaging in Moscow and the Russian 
troops were quietly encamped at Tariitino, a 
change had taken place in the relative strength 
of the two armies both in spirit and in num- 
beras a result of which the superiority had 
passed to the Russian side. Though the condi- 
tion and numbers of the French army were un- 
known to the Russians, as soon as that change 
occurred the need of attacking at once showed 
itself by countless signs. These signs were: 
Lauriston's mission; the abundance of pro- 
visions at Tarutino; the reports coming in from 
all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the 
French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; 
the fine weather; the long rest the Russian 
soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to 
do what they had been assembled for, which 
usually shows itself in an army that has been 
resting; curiosity as to what the French army, 
so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness 
with which our outposts now scouted close up 



BOOK THIRTEEN 565 

to the French stationed at Tarutino; the news 
of easy successes gained by peasants and guer- 
rilla troops over the French, the envy aroused 
by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the 
heart of every Russian as long as the French 
were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim con- 
sciousness in every soldier's mind that the rel- 
ative strength of the armies had changed and 
that the advantage was now on our side. There 
was a substantial change in the relative strength, 
and an advance had become inevitable. And 
at once, as a clock begins to strike and chime 
as soon as the minute hand has completed a 
full circle, this change was shown by an in- 
creased activity, whirring, and chiming in the 
higher spheres. 



CHAPTER III 

THE RUSSIAN ARMY was commanded by Kutu- 
zov and his staff, and also by the Emperor from 
Petersburg. Before the news of the abandon- 
ment of Moscow had been received in Peters- 
burg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign 
had been drawn up and sent to Kutuzov for 
his guidance. Though this plan had been 
drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was 
still in our hands, it was approved by the 
staff and accepted as a basis for action. Kutu- 
zov only replied that movements arranged 
from a distance were always difficult to execute. 
So fresh instructions were sent for the solu- 
tion of difficulties that might be encountered, 
as well as fresh people who were to watch Ku- 
tiizov's actions and report upon them. 

Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian 
army was now reorganized. The posts left va- 
cant by Bagrati6n, who had been killed, and 
by Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, 
had to be filled. Very serious consideration 
was given to the question whether it would be 
better to put A in B's place and B in D's, or on 
the contrary to put D in A's place, and so on 
as if anything more than A's or B's satisfaction 
depended on this. 

As a result of the hostility between Kutuzov 
and Bennigsen, his Chief of Staff, the presence 
of confidential representatives of the Emperor, 
and these transfers, a more than usually com- 
plicated play of parties was going on among 
the staff of the army. A was undermining B, 
D was undermining C, and so on in all possi- 
ble combinations and permutations. In all 
these plottings the subject of intrigue was gen- 
erally the conduct of the war, which all these 
men believed they were directing; but this af- 
fair of the war went on independently of them, 



5 66 



WAR AND PEACE 



as it had to go: that is, never in the way peo- 
ple devised, but flowing always from the es- 
sential attitude of the masses. Only in the high- 
est spheres did all these schemes, crossings, and 
interminglings appear to be a true reflection 
of what had to happen. 

Prince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Em- 
peror on the second of October in a letter that 
reached Kutuzov after the battle at Tarutino) 
Since September 2 Moscow has been in the hands 
of the enemy. Your last reports were written on 
the twentieth, and during all this time not only 
has no action been taken against the enemy or for 
the relief of the ancient capital, but according to 
your last report you have even retreated farther. 
Serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy de- 
tachment and Tula with its famous arsenal, so in- 
dispensable to the army, is in danger. From Gen- 
eral Wintzingerode's reports, I see lhat an enemy 
corps of ten thousand men is moving on the Peters- 
burg road. Another corps of several thousand men 
is moving on Dmftrov. A third has advanced along 
the Vladimir road, and a fourth, rather consider- 
able detachment is stationed between Ruza and 
Mozhaysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as 
late as the twenty-fifth. In view of all this informa- 
tion, when the enemy has scattered his forces in 
large detachments, and with Napoleon and his 
Guards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemy's 
forces confronting you are so considerable as not 
to allow of your taking the offensive? On the con- 
trary, he is probably pursuing you with detach- 
ments, or at most with an army corps much 
weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would 
seem that, availing yourself of these circumstances, 
you might advantageously attack a weaker enemy 
and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to re- 
treat, retaining in our hands an important part 
of the provinces now occupied by the enemy, and 
thereby averting danger from Tula and other 
towns in the interior. You will be responsible if 
the enemy is able to direct a force of any si/e 
against Petersburg to threaten this capital in 
which it has not been possible to retain many 
troops; for with the army entrusted to you, and 
acting with resolution and energy, you have ample 
means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember 
that you have still to answer to our offended 
country for the loss of Moscow. You have experi- 
enced my readiness to reward you. That readiness 
will not weaken in me, but I and Russia have a 
right to expect from you all the zeal, firmness, and 
success which your intellect, military talent, and 
the courage of the troops you command justify us 
in expecting. 

But by the time this letter, which proved 
that the real relation of the forces had already 
made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched, 
Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer 
to restrain the army he commanded from at- 



tacking and a battle had taken place. 

On the second of October a Cossack, Shapo- 
valov, who was out scouting, killed one hare 
and wounded another. Following the wounded 
hare he made his way far into the forest and 
came upon the left flank of Murat's army, en- 
camped there without any precautions. The 
Cossack laughingly told his comrades how he 
had almost fallen into the hands of the French. 
A cornet, hearing the story, informed his com- 
mander. 

The Cossack was sent for and questioned. 
The Cossack officers wished to take advantage 
of this chance to capture some horses, but one 
of the superior officers, who was acquainted 
with the higher authorities, reported the in- 
cident to a general on the staff. The state of 
things on the staff had of late been exceeding- 
ly strained. Erm61ov had been to see Bennig- 
sen a few days previously and had entreated 
him to use his influence with the commander 
in chief to induce him to take the offensive. 

"If I did not know you I should think you 
did not want what you are asking for. I need 
only advise anything and his Highness is sure 
to do the opposite," replied Bennigsen. 

The Cossack's report, confirmed by horse 
patrols who were sent out, was the final proof 
that events had matured. The tightly coiled 
spring was released, the clock began to whirr 
and the chimes to play. Despite all his sup- 
posed power, his intellect, his experience, and 
his knowledge of men, Kutiizov having taken 
into consideration the Cossack's report, a note 
from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to 
the Emperor, the wishes he supposed the Em- 
peror to hold, and the fact that all the generals 
expressed the same wishcould no longer check 
the inevitable movement, and gave the order 
to do what he regarded as useless and harmful 
gave his approval, that is, to the accomplished 
fact. 

CHAPTER IV 

BKNNIGSEN'S NOTE and the Cossack's informa- 
tion that the left flank of the French was un- 
guarded were merely final indications that it 
was necessary to order an attack, and it was 
fixed for the fifth of October. 

On the morning of the fourth of October 
Kutuzov signed the dispositions. Toll read 
them to Erm61ov, asking him to attend to the 
further arrangements. 

"All right all right. I haven't time just now," 
replied Erm61ov, and left the hut. 

The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very 



BOOK THIRTEEN 

good. As in the Austerlitz dispositions, it was 
writtenthough not in German this time: 

"The First Column will march here and 
here," "the Second Column will march there 
and there," and so on; and on paper, all these 
columns arrived at their places at the appointed 
time and destroyed the enemy. Everything had 
been admirably thought out as is usual in dis- 
positions, and as is always the case, not a single 
column reached its place at the appointed 
time. 

When the necessary number of copies of the 
dispositions had been prepared, an officer was 
summoned and sent to deliver them to Ermo- 
lov to deal with. A young officer of the Horse 
Guards, Kutuzov's orderly, pleased at the im- 
portance of the mission entrusted to him, went 
to Erm61ov's quarters. 

"Gone away," said Erm61ov's orderly. 

The officer of the Horse Guards went to a 
general with whom Ermolov was often to be 
found. 

"No, and the general's out too." 

The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to 
someone else. 

"No, he's gone out." 

"If only they don't make me responsible for 
this delay! What a nuisance it is!" thought the 
officer, and he rode round the whole camp. 
One man said he had seen Erm61ov ride past 
with some other generals, others said he must 
have returned home. The officer searched till 
six o'clock in the evening without even stop- 
ping to eat. Ermolov was nowhere to be found 
and no one knew where he was. The officer 
snatched a little food at a comrade's, and rode 
again to the vanguard to find Miloradovich. 
Milorddovich too was away, but here he was 
told that he had gone to a ball at General Ki- 
kin's and that Erm61ov was probably there 
too. 

"But where is it?" 

"Why, there, over at Echkino," said a Cos- 
sack officer, pointing to a country house in the 
far distance. 

"What, outside our line?" 

"They've put two regiments as outposts, and 
they're having such a spree there, it's awful 1 
Two bands and three sets of singers!" 
f The officer rode out beyond our lines to 
Echkino. While still at a distance he heard as 
he rode the merry sounds of a soldier's dance 
song proceeding from the house. 

"In the meadows ... in the meadows!" he 
heard, accompanied by whistling and the sound 
of a torban, drowned every now and then by 



567 

shouts. These sounds made his spirits rise, but 
at the same time he was afraid that he would 
be blamed for not having executed sooner the 
important order entrusted to him. It was al- 
ready past eight o'clock. He dismounted and 
went up into the porch of a large country 
house which had remained intact between the 
Russian and French forces. In the refreshment 
room and the hall, footmen were bustling 
about with wine and viands. Groups of singers 
stood outside the windows. The officer was ad- 
mitted and immediately saw all the chief gen- 
erals of the army together, and among them 
Ermolov's big imposing figure. They all had 
their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a 
semicircle with flushed and animated faces, 
laughing loudly. In the middle of the room a 
short handsome general with a red face was 
dancing the trepdk with much spirit and agil- 
ity. 

"Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Ivdnych! Ha, 
ha, ha!" 

The officer felt that by arriving with impor- 
tant orders at such a moment he was doubly to 
blame, and he would have preferred to wait; 
but one of the generals espied him and, hear- 
ing what he had come about, informed Erm6- 
lov. 

Ermolov came forward with a frown on his 
face and, hearing what the officer had to say, 
took the papers from him without a word. 

"You think he went off just by chance?" said 
a comrade, who was on the staff that evening, 
to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to 
Ermolov. "It was a trick. It was done on pur- 
pose to get Konovnitsyn into trouble. You'll 
see what a mess there'll be tomorrow." 

CHAPTER V 

NEXT DAY the decrepit Kutiizov, having given 
orders to be called early, said his prayers, 
dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness 
of having to direct a battle he did not approve 
of, got into his caleche and drove from Leta- 
sh6vka (a village three and a half miles from 
Tariitino) to the place where the attacking 
columns were to meet. He sat in the caltche, 
dozing and waking up by turns, and listening 
for any sound of firing on the right as an indi- 
cation that the action had begun. But all was 
still quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was 
just dawning. On approaching Tariitino Ku- 
tiizov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses 
to water across the road along which he was 
driving. Kutiizov looked at them searchingly, 



568 

stopped his carriage, and inquired what regi- 
ment they belonged to. They belonged to a 
column that should have been far in front and 
in ambush long before then. "It may be a mis- 
take," thought the old commander in chief. 
But a little further on he saw infantry regi- 
ments with their arms piled and the soldiers, 
only partly dressed, eating their rye porridge 
and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The 
officer reported that no order to advance had 
been received. 

"How! Not rec . . ." Kutuzov began, but 
checked himself immediately and sent for a 
senior officer. Getting out of his caltche, he 
waited with drooping head and breathing 
heavily, pacing silently up and down. When 
Efkhen, the officer of the general staff whom 
he had summoned, appeared, Kutuzov went 
purple in the face, not because that officer was 
to blame for the mistake, but because he was 
an object of sufficient importance for him to 
vent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the 
old man fell into that state of fury in which he 
sometimes used to roll on the ground, and he 
fell upon Eykhen, threatening him with his 
hands, shouting and loading him with gross 
abuse. Another man, Captain Br6zin, who hap- 
pened to turn up and who was not at all to 
blame, suffered the same fate. 

"What sort of another blackguard are you? 
I'll have you shot! Scoundrels!" yelled Kutu- 
zov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and reel- 
ing. 

He was suffering physically. He, the com- 
mander in chief, a Serene Highness who every- 
body said possessed powers such as no man had 
ever had in Russia, to be placed in this posi- 
tionmade the laughingstock of the whole ar- 
my! "I needn't have been in such a hurry to 
pray about today, or have kept awake think- 
ing everything over all night," thought he to 
himself. "When I was a chit of an officer no 
one would have dared to mock me so ... and 
now!" He was in a state of physical suffering 
as if from corporal punishment, and could not 
avoid expressing it by cries of anger and dis- 
tress. But his strength soon began to fail him, 
and looking about him, conscious of having 
said much that was amiss, he again got into his 
caliche and drove back in silence. 

His wrath, once expended, did not return, 
and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and 
self-justifications (Erm61ov did not come to 
see him till the next day) and to the insistence 
of Bennigsen, Konovnitsyn, and Toll that the 
movement that had miscarried should be exe- 



WAR AND PEACE 

cuted next day. And once more Kutiizov had 
to consent. 

CHAPTER VI 

NEXT DAY the troops assembled in their ap- 
pointed places in the evening and advanced 
during the night. It was an autumn night with 
dark purple clouds, but no rain. The ground 
was damp but not muddy, and the troops ad- 
vanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling 
of the artillery could be faintly heard. The 
men were forbidden to talk out loud, to smoke 
their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried 
to prevent their horses neighing. The secrecy 
of the undertaking heightened its charm and 
they marched gaily. Some columns, supposing 
they had reached their destination, halted, 
piled arms, and settled down on the cold 
ground, but the majority marched all night 
and arrived at places where they evidently 
should not have been. 

Only Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cos- 
sacks (the least important detachment of all) 
got to his appointed place at the right time. 
This detachment halted at the outskirts of a 
forest, on the path leading from the village of 
Stromilova to Dmftrovsk. 

Toward dawn, Count Orlov-Denfsov, who 
had dozed off, was awakened by a deserter from 
the French army being brought to him. This 
was a Polish sergeant of Poniatowski's corps, 
who explained in Polish that he had come 
over because he had been slighted in the serv- 
ice: that he ought long ago to have been made 
an officer, that he was braver than any of them, 
and so he had left them and wished to pay 
them out. He said that Murat was spending 
the night less than a mile from where they 
were, and that if they would let him have a 
convoy of a hundred men he would capture 
him alive. Count Orl6v-Denfsov consulted his 
fellow officers. 

The offer was too tempting to be refused. 
Everyone volunteered to go and everybody ad- 
vised making the attempt. After much disput- 
ing and arguing, Major-General Grkov with 
two Cossack regiments decided to go with the 
Polish sergeant. 

"Now, remember," said Count Orl6v-Denf- 
sov to the sergeant at parting, "if you have 
been lying I'll have you hanged like a dog; but 
if it's true you shall have a hundred gold 
pieces!" 

Without replying, the sergeant, with a reso- 
lute air, mounted and rode away with Grkov 
whose men had quickly assembled. They dis-

569 



appeared into the forest, and Count Orl6v- 
Denfsov, having seen Grkov off, returned, 
shivering from the freshness of the early dawn 
and excited by what he had undertaken on his 
own responsibility, and began looking at the 
enemy camp, now just visible in the deceptive 
light of dawn and the dying campfires. Our 
columns ought to have begun to appear on an 
open declivity to his right. He looked in that 
direction, but though the columns would have 
been visible quite far off, they were not to be 
seen. It seemed to the count that things were 
beginning to stir in the French camp, and his 
keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this. 

"Oh, it is really too late," said Count Orl6v, 
looking at the camp. 

As often happens when someone we have 
trusted is no longer before our eyes, it sudden- 
ly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that 
the sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, 
and that the whole Russian attack would be 
ruined by the absence of those two regiments, 
which he would lead away heaven only knew 
where. How could one capture a commander 
in chief from among such a mass of troops! 

"I am sure that rascal was lying," said the 
count. 

"They can still be called back," said one of 
his suite, who like Count Orlov felt distrustful 
of the adventure when he looked at the en- 
emy's camp. 

"Eh? Really . . . what do you think? Should 
we let them go on or not?" 

"Will you have them fetched back?" 

"Fetch them back, fetch them backl" said 
Count Orlov with sudden determination, look- 
ing at his watch. "It will be too late. It is quite 
light." 

And the adjutant galloped through the 
forest after Grkov. When Grkov returned, 
Count Orl6v-Denfsov, excited both by the 
abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the 
infantry columns that still did not appear, as 
well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved 
to advance. All his men felt the same excite- 
ment. 

"Mountl" he commanded in a whisper. The 
men took their places and crossed themselves. 
. . . "Forward, with God's aid!" 

"Hurrah-ah-ahl" reverberated in the forest, 
and the Cossack companies, trailing their 
lances and advancing one after another as if 
poured out of a sack, dashed gaily across the 
brook toward the camp. 

One desperate, frightened yell from the first 
French soldier who saw the Cossacks, and all 



who were in the camp, undressed and only just 
waking up, ran off in all directions, abandon- 
ing cannons, muskets, and horses. 

Had the Cossacks pursued the French, with- 
out heeding what was behind and around 
them, they would have captured Murat and 
everything there. That was what the officers 
desired. But it was impossible to make the Cos- 
sacks budge when once they had got booty and 
prisoners. None of them listened to orders. 
Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight 
guns were taken on the spot, besides standards 
and (what seemed most important to the Cos- 
sacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. 
All this had to be dealt with, the prisoners and 
guns secured, the booty divided not without 
some shouting and even a little fighting among 
themselves and it was on this that the Cos- 
sacks all busied themselves. 

The French, not being farther pursued, be- 
gan to recover themselves: they formed into 
detachments and began firing. Orl6v-Denisov, 
still waiting for the other columns to arrive, 
advanced no further. 

Meantime, according to the dispositions 
which said that "the First Column will march" 
and so on, the infantry of the belated columns, 
commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, 
had started in due order and, as always hap- 
pens, had got somewhere, but not to their ap- 
pointed places. As always happens the men, 
starting cheerfully, began to halt; murmurs 
were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and 
finally a backward movement. Adjutants and 
generals galloped about, shouted, grew angry, 
quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and 
were late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at 
last gave it all up and went forward, simply to 
get somewhere. "We shall get somewhere or 
other!" And they did indeed get somewhere, 
though not to their right places; a few even- 
tually even got to their right place, but too 
late to be of any use and only in time to be 
fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the 
part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped as- 
siduously from place to place, finding every- 
thing upside down everywhere. Thus he stum- 
bled on Bagovut's corps in a wood when it was 
already broad daylight, though the corps should 
long before have joined Orl6v-Denisov. Ex- 
cited and vexed by the failure and supposing 
that someone must be responsible for it, Toll 
galloped up to the commander of the corps 
and began upbraiding him severely, saying that 
he ought to be shot. General Bagoviit, a fight- 
ing old soldier of placid temperament, being 



57&lt;&gt; 

also upset by all the delay, confusion, and 
cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody's 
surprise and quite contrary to his usual char- 
acter and said disagreeable things to Toll. 

"I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, 
but I can die with my men as well as anybody," 
he said, and advanced with a single division. 

Coming out onto a field under the enemy's 
fire, this brave general went straight ahead, 
leading his men under fire, without consider- 
ing in his agitation whether going into action 
now, with a single division, would be of any 
use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets 
were just what he needed in his angry mood. 
One of the first bullets killed him, and other 
bullets killed many of his men. And his divi- 
sion remained under fire for some time quite 
uselessly. 

CHAPTER VII 

MEANWHILE ANOTHER COLUMN was to have at- 
tacked the French from the front, but Kutu 
zov accompanied that column. He well knew 
that nothing but confusion would come of this 
battle undertaken against his will, and as far 
as was in his power held the troops back. He 
did not advance. 

He rode silently on his small gray horse, in- 
dolently answering suggestions that they should 
attack. 

"The word attack is always on your tongue, 
but you don't see that we are unable to execute 
complicated maneuvers," said he to Milora- 
dovich who asked permission to advance. 

"We couldn't take Murat prisoner this morn- 
ing or get to the place in time, and nothing 
can be done now!" he replied to someone else. 

When Kutuzov was informed that at the 
French rear where according to the reports 
of the Cossacks there had previously been no- 
bodythere were now two battalions of Poles, 
he gave a sidelong glance at Erm61ov who was 
behind him and to whom he had not spoken 
since the previous day. 

"You see! They are asking to attack and mak- 
ing plans of all kinds, but as soon as one gets 
to business nothing is ready, and the enemy, 
forewarned, takes measures accordingly." 

Erm61ov screwed up his eyes and smiled 
faintly on hearing these words. He understood 
that for him the storm had blown over, and 
that Kutuzov would content himself with that 
hint. 

"He's having a little fun at my expense/' 
said Ermolov softly, nudging with his knee 
Raevski who was at his side. 



WAR AND PEACE 

Soon after this, Erm61ov moved up to Kutu- 
zov and respectfully remarked: 

"It is not too late yet, your Highnessthe 
enemy has not gone away if you were to or- 
der an attack! If not, the Guards will not so 
much as see a little smoke." 

Kutuzov did not reply, but when they re- 
ported to him that Murat's troops were in re- 
treat he ordered an advance, though at every 
hundred paces he halted for three quarters of 
an hour. 

The whole battle consisted in what Orl6v- 
Denisov's Cossacks had done: the rest of the 
army merely lost some hundreds of men use- 
lessly. 

In consequence of this battle Kutuzov re- 
ceived a dianiond decoration, and Bennigsen 
some diamonds and a hundred thousand ru- 
bles, others also received pleasant recognitions 
corresponding to their various grades, and fol- 
lowing the battle fresh changes were made in 
the staff. 

"That's how everything is done with us, all 
topsy-turvy!" said the Russian officers and gen- 
erals after the Tarutino battle, letting it be 
understood that some fool there is doing things 
all wrong but that we ourselves should not have 
done so, just as people speak today. But peo- 
ple who talk like that either do not know what 
they are talking about or deliberately deceive 
themselves. No battle Tarutino, Borodin6, or 
Austerlitz takes place as those who planned 
it anticipated. That is an essential condition. 
. A countless number of free forces (for no- 
where is man freer than during a battle, where 
it is a question of life and death) influence the 
course taken by the fight, and that course nev- 
er can be known in advance and never coin- 
cides with the direction of any one force. 

If many simultaneously and variously di- 
rected forces act on a given body, the direction 
of its motion cannot coincide with any one of 
those forces, but will always be a mean what 
in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of 
a parallelogram of forces. 

If in the descriptions given by historians, 
especially French ones, we find their wars and 
battles carried out in accordance with previ- 
ously formed plans, the only conclusion to be 
drawn is that those descriptions are false. 

The battle of Tariitino obviously did not 
attain the aim Toll had in view to lead the 
troops into action in the order prescribed by 
the dispositions; nor that which Count Orl6v- 
Denisov may have had in view to take Murat 
prisoner; nor the result of immediately de- 



BOOK THIRTEEN 

stroying the whole corps, which Bennigsen and 
others may have had in view; nor the aim of 
the officer who wished to go into action to dis- 
tinguish himself; nor that of the Cossack who 
wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But 
if the aim of the battle was what actually re- 
sulted and what all the Russians of that day 
desired to drive the French out of Russia and 
destroy their army it is quite clear that the 
battle of Tanitino, just because of its incon- 
gruities, was exactly what was wanted at that 
stage of the campaign. It would be difficult 
and even impossible to imagine any result more 
opportune than the actual outcome of this bat- 
tle. With a minimum of effort and insignifi- 
cant losses, despite the greatest confusion, the 
most important results of the whole campaign 
were attained: the transition from retreat to 
advance, an exposure of the weakness of the 
Frdnch, and the administration of that shock 
which Napoleon's army had only awaited to 
begin its flight.

CHAPTER VIII 

NAPOLEON ENTERS Moscow after the brilliant 
victory de la Moskowa; there can be no doubt 
about the victory for the battlefield remains in 
the hands of the French. The Russians retreat 
and abandon their ancient capital. Moscow, 
abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and 
incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon's hands. 
The Russian army, only half the strength of 
the French, does not make a single attempt to 
attack for a whole month. Napoleon's position 
is most brilliant. He can either fall on the Rus- 
sian army with double its strength and destroy 
it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case 
of a refusal make a menacing move on Peters- 
burg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return 
to Smolensk or Vflna; or remain in Moscow; 
in short, no special genius would seem to be 
required to retain the brilliant position the 
French held at that time. For that, only very 
simple and easy steps were necessary: not to 
allow the troops to loot, to prepare winter 
clothing of which there was sufficient in Mos- 
cow for the whole army and methodically to 
collect the provisions, of which (according to 
the French historians) there were enough in 
Moscow to supply the whole army for six 
months. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of all 
geniuses, who the historians declare had con- 
trol of the army, took none of these steps. 

He not merely did nothing of the kind, but 
on the contrary he used his power to select the 
most foolish and ruinous of all the courses 



open to him. Of all that Napoleon might have 
done: wintering in Moscow, advancing on 
Petersburg or on Nizhni-N6vgorod, or retiring 
by a more northerly or more southerly route 
(say by the road Kuttizov afterwards took), 
nothing more stupid or disastrous can be im- 
agined than what he actually did. He remained 
in Moscow till October, letting the troops 
plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to 
leave a garrison behind him, he quitted Mos- 
cow, approached Kutuzov without joining bat- 
tle, turned to the right and reached Malo- 
Yarosldvets, again without attempting to break 
through and take the road Kutuzov took, but 
retiring instead to Mozhdysk along the dev- 
astated Smolensk road. Nothing more stupid 
than that could have been devised, or more 
disastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. 
Had Napoleon's aim been to destroy his army, 
the most skillful strategist could hardly have 
devised any series of actions that would so com- 
pletely have accomplished that purpose, inde- 
pendently of anything the Russian army might 
do. 

Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But 
to say that he destroyed his army because he 
wished to, or because he was very stupid, would 
be as unjust as to say that he had brought his 
troops to Moscow because he wished to and be- 
cause he was very clever and a genius. 

In both cases his personal activity, having 
no more force than the personal activity of 
any soldier, merely coincided with the laws 
that guided the event. 

The historians quite falsely represent Na- 
poleon's faculties as having weakened in Mos- 
cow, and do so only because the results did 
not justify his actions. He employed all his 
ability and strength to do the best he could for 
himself and his army, as he had done previous- 
ly and as he did subsequently in 1813. His ac- 
tivity at that time was no less astounding than 
it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in 
Prussia. We do not know for certain in how 
far his genius was genuine in Egypt where 
forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur 
for his great exploits there are all told us by 
Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his 
genius in Austria or Prussia, for we have to 
draw our information from French or German 
sources, and the incomprehensible surrender 
of whole corps without fighting and of for- 
tresses without a siege must incline Germans 
to recognize his genius as the only explanation 
of the war carried on in Germany. But we, 
thank God, kave no need to recognize his gen- 



57* 



WAR AND PEACE 



ius in order to hide our shame. We have paid 
for the right to look at the matter plainly and 
simply, and we will not abandon that right. 

His activity in Moscow was as amazing and 
as full of genius as elsewhere. Order after or- 
der and plan after plan were issued by him 
from the time he entered Moscow till the time 
he left it. The absence of citizens and of a dep- 
utation, and even the burning of Moscow, 
did not disconcert him. He did not lose sight 
either of the welfare of his army or of the do- 
ings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the peo- 
ple of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in 
Paris, or of diplomatic considerations con- 
cerning the terms of the anticipated peace. 

CHAPTER IX 

WITH REGARD to military matters, Napoleon 
immediately on his entry into Moscow gave 
General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the 
movements of the Russian army, sent army 
corps out along the different roads, and charged 
Murat to find Kutuzov. Then he gave careful 
directions about the fortification of the Kre*m- 
lin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future 
campaign over the whole map of Russia. 

With regard to diplomatic questions, Napo- 
leon summoned Captain Yakovlev, who had 
been robbed and was in rags and did not know 
how to get out of Moscow, minutely explained 
to him his whole policy and his magnanimity, 
and having written a letter to the Emperor 
Alexander in which he considered it his duty 
to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostop- 
chin had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he 
dispatched Ydkovlev to Petersburg. 

Having similarly explained his views and his 
magnanimity to Tut61min, he dispatched that 
old man also to Petersburg to negotiate. 

With regard to legal matters, immediately 
after the fires he gave orders to find and exe- 
cute'the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Ros- 
topchfn was punished by an order to burn 
down his houses. 

With regard to administrative matters, Mos- 
cow was granted a constitution. A municipality 
was established and the following announce- 
ment issued: 

INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW! 
Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the 
Emperor and King desires to arrest their course. 
Terrible examples have taught you how he pun- 
ishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have 
been taken to put an end to disorder and to re- 
establish public security. A paternal administra- 
tion, chosen from among yourselves, will form 



your municipality or city government. It will take 
care of you, of your needs, and of your welfare. Its 
members will be distinguished by a red ribbon 
worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the 
city will wear a white belt as well. But when not 
on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round 
the left arm. 

The city police is established on its former foot- 
ing, and better order already prevails in conse- 
quence of its activity. The government has ap- 
pointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of 
police, and twenty commissaries or captains of 
wards have been appointed to the different wards 
of the city. You will recognize them by the white 
ribbon they will wear on the left arm. Several 
churches of different denominations are open, and 
divine service is performed in them unhindered. 
Your fellow citizens are returning every day to 
their homes, and orders have been given that they 
should find in them the help and protection due 
to their misfortunes. These are the measures the 
government has adopted to re-establish order and 
relieve your condition. But to achieve this aim it is 
necessary that you should add your efforts and 
should, if possible, forget the misfortunes you have 
suffered, should entertain the hope of a less cruel 
fate, should be certain that inevitable and ignomin- 
ious death awaits those who make any attempt 
on your persons or on what remains of your prop- 
erty, and finally that you should not doubt that 
these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of 
the greatest and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and 
citizens, of whatever nation you may be, re-estab- 
lish public confidence, the source of the welfare of 
a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and 
protection one to another, unite to defeat the in- 
tentions of the evil-minded, obey the military and 
civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to 
flow! 

With regard to supplies for the army, Napo- 
leon decreed that all the troops in turn should 
enter Moscow d la maraude * to obtain provi- 
sions for themselves, so that the army might 
have its future provided for. 

With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered 
the priests to be brought back and services to 
be again performed in the churches. 

With regard to commerce and to provision- 
ing the army, the following was placarded 
everywhere: 

PROCLAMATION 

You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans 
and workmen whom misfortune has driven from 
the city, and you scattered tillers of the soil, still 
kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen! 
Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order 
is being restored in it. Your fellow countrymen are 
emerging boldly from their hiding places on find- 

1 As looters. 



BOOK THIRTEEN 



57S 



ing that they are respected. Any violence to them 
or to their property is promptly punished. His 
Majesty the Emperor and King protects them, and 
considers no one among you his enemy except 
those who disobey his orders. He desires to end 
your misfortunes and restore you to your homes 
and families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent 
intentions and come to us without fear. Inhabi- 
tants, return with confidence to your abodes! You 
will soon find means of satisfying your needs. 
Craftsmen and industrious artisans, return to your 
work, your houses, your shops, where the protec- 
tion of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper 
pay for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, 
come from the forests where you are hiding in 
terror, return to your huts without fear, in full 
assurance that you will find protection! Markets 
are established in the city where peasants can bring 
their surplus supplies and the products of the soil. 
The government has taken the following steps to 
ensure freedom of sale for them: (i) From today, 
peasants, husbandmen, and those living in the 
neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger 
bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed 
markets, of which one is on the Mokhovaya Street 
and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such 
supplies will be bought from them at such prices 
as seller and buyer may agree on, and if a seller 
is unable to obtain a fair price he will be free to 
take his goods back to his village and no one may 
hinder him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and 
Wednesday of each week are appointed as the chief 
market days and to that end a sufficient number of 
troops will be stationed along the highroads on 
Tuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the 
town as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures 
will be taken that peasants with their carts and 
horses may meet with no hindrance on their re- 
turn journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken 
to re-establish ordinary trading. 

Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, 
workingmen and artisans, to whatever nation you 
belong, you are called on to carry out the paternal 
intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King 
and to co-operate with him for the public welfare! 
Lay your respect and confidence at his feet and do 
not delay to unite with us! 

With the object of raising the spirits of the 
troops and of the people, reviews were con- 
stantly held and rewards distributed. The Em- 
peror rode through the streets to comfort the 
inhabitants, and, despite his preoccupation 
with state affairs, himself visited the theaters 
that were established by his order. 

In regard to philanthropy, the greatest vir- 
tue of crowned heads, Napoleon also did all in 
his power. He caused the words Maison de ma 
M&amp;re to be inscribed on the charitable institu- 
tions, thereby combining tender filial affection 
with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. 



He visited the Foundling Hospital and, allow- 
ing the orphans saved by him to kiss his white 
hands, graciously conversed with Tutolmin. 
Then, as Thiers eloquently recounts, he or- 
dered his soldiers to be paid in forged Russian 
money which he had prepared: "Raising the 
use of these means by an act worthy of himself 
and of the French army, he let relief be dis- 
tributed to those who had been burned out. 
But as food was too precious to be given to 
foreigners, who were for the most part ene- 
mies, Napoleon preferred to supply them with 
money with which to purchase food from out- 
side, and had paper rubles distributed to them." 
With reference to army discipline, orders 
were continually being issued to inflict severe 
punishment for the non performance of mili- 
tary duties and to suppress robbery. 

CHAPTER X 

BUT STRANGE TO SAY, all these measures, efforts, 
and plans which were not at all worse than 
others issued in similar circumstances did not 
affect the essence of the matter but, like the 
hands of a clock detached from the mechanism, 
swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way 
without engaging the cogwheels. 

With reference to the military side the plan 
of campaign that work of genius of which 
Thiers remarks that, "His genius never de- 
vised anything more profound, more skillful, 
or more admirable," and enters into a polemic 
with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius 
must be referred not to the fourth but to the 
fifteenth of October that plan never was or 
could be executed, for it was quite out of 
touch with the facts of the case. The fortifying 
of the Kremlin, for which la Mosqute (as Na- 
poleon termed the church of Basil the Beati- 
fied) was to have been razed to the ground, 
proved quite useless. The mining of the Krm- 
lin only helped toward fulfilling Napoleon's 
wish that it should be blown up when he left 
Moscow as a child wants the floor on which 
he has hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit 
of the Russian army, about which Napoleon 
was so concerned, produced an unheard-of re- 
sult. The French generals lost touch with the 
Russian army of sixty thousand men, and ac- 
cording to Thiers it was only eventually found, 
like a lost pin, by the skilland apparently the 
genius of Murat. 

With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon's 
arguments as to his magnanimity and justice, 
both to Tut61min and to Ykovlev (whose 
chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a 



574 



WAR AND PEACE 



conveyance), proved useless; Alexander did 
not receive these envoys and did not reply to 
their embassage. 

With regard to legal matters, after the exe- 
cution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of 
Moscow burned down. 

With regard to administrative matters, the 
establishment of a municipality did not stop 
the robberies and was only of use to certain 
people who formed part of that municipality 
and under pretext of preserving order looted 
Moscow or saved their own property from be- 
ing looted. 

With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt 
matters had so easily been settled by Napo- 
leon's visit to a mosque, no results were 
achieved. Two or three priests who were found 
in Moscow did try to carry out Napoleon's 
wish, but one of them was slapped in the face 
by a French soldier while conducting service, 
and a French official reported of another that: 
"The priest whom I found and invited to say 
Mass cleaned and locked up the church. That 
night the doors were again broken open, the 
padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and 
other disorders perpetrated." 

With reference to commerce, the proclama- 
tion to industrious workmen and to peasants 
evoked no response. There were no industri- 
ous workmen, and the peasants caught the com- 
missaries who ventured too far out of town 
with the proclamation and killed them. 

As to the theaters for the entertainment of 
the people and the troops, these did not meet 
with success either. The theaters set up in the 
Kremlin and in Posnyakov's house were closed 
again at once because the actors and actresses 
were robbed. 

Even philanthropy did not have the desired 
effect. The genuine as well as the false paper 
money which flooded Moscow lost its value. 
The French, collecting booty, cared only for 
gold. Not only was the paper money valueless 
which Napoleon so graciously distributed to 
the unfortunate, but even silver lost its value 
in relation to gold. 

But the most amazing example of the inef- 
fectiveness of the orders given by the authori- 
ties at that time was Napoleon's attempt to 
stop the looting and re-establish discipline. 

This is what the army authorities were re- 
porting: 

"Looting continues in the city despite the 
decrees against it. Order is not yet restored and 
not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a 
lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to 



trade, and they sell stolen goods." 

"The neighborhood of my ward continues 
to be pillaged by soldiers of the $rd Corps 
who, not satisfied with taking from the unfor- 
tunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the 
little they have left, even have the ferocity to 
wound them with their sabers, as I have re- 
peatedly witnessed." 

"Nothing new, except that the soldiers are 
robbing and pillaging October 9." 

"Robbery and pillaging continue. There is 
a band of thieves in our district who ought to 
be arrested by a strong force October 1 1." 

"The Emperor is extremely displeased that 
despite the strict orders to stop pillage, parties 
of marauding Guards are continually seen re- 
turning to the Kremlin. Among the Old Guard 
disorder and pillage were renewed more vio- 
lently than ever yesterday evening, last night, 
and today. The Emperor sees with regret that 
the picked soldiers appointed to guard his per- 
son, who should set an example of discipline, 
carry disobedience to such a point that they 
break into the cellars and stores containing 
army supplies. Others have disgraced them- 
selves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and 
officers, and have abused and beaten them." 

"The Grand Marshal of the palace," wrote 
the governor, "complains bitterly that in spite 
of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to 
commit nuisances in all the courtyards and 
even under the very windows of the Emperor." 

That army, like a herd of cattle run wild 
and trampling underfoot the provender which 
might have saved it from starvation, disinte- 
grated and perished with each additional day 
it remained in Moscow. But it did not go away. 

It began to run away only when suddenly 
seized by a panic caused by the capture of trans- 
port trains on the Smolensk road, and by the 
battle of Tanitino. The news of that battle of 
Tarutino, unexpectedly received by Napoleon 
at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish 
the Russians (Thiers says), and he issued the 
order for departure which the whole army was 
demanding. 

Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with 
them everything they had stolen. Napoleon, 
too, carried away his own personal trdsor, but 
on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the 
army, he was (Thiers says) horror-struck. And 
yet with his experience of war he did not order 
all the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he 
had done with those of a certain marshal when 
approaching Moscow. He gazed at the caliches 
and carriages in which soldiers were riding and 



BOOK THIRTEEN 

remarked that it was a very good thing, as those 
vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the 
sick, and the wounded. 

The plight of the whole army resembled 
that of a wounded animal which feels it is per- 
ishing and does not know what it is doing. To 
study the skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon 
and his army from the time it entered Moscow 
till it was destroyed is like studying the dying 
leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded ani- 
mal. Very often a wounded animal, hearing a 
rustle, rushes straight at the hunter's gun, runs 
forward and back again, and hastens its own 
end. Napoleon, under pressure from his whole 
army, did the same thing. The rustle of the 
battle of Tarutino frightened the beast, and it 
rushed forward onto the hunter's gun, reached 
him, turned back, and finally like any wild 
beast ran back along the most disadvanta- 
geous and dangerous path, where the old scent 
was familiar. 

During the whole of that period Napoleon, 
who seems to us to have been the leader of all 
these movements as the figurehead of a ship 
may seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted 
like a child who, holding a couple of strings 
inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.

CHAPTER XI 

EARLY IN THE MORNING of the sixth of October 
Pierre went out of the shed, and on returning 
stopped by the door to play with a little blue- 
gray dog, with a long body and short bandy 
legs, that jumped about him. This little dog 
lived in their shed, sleeping beside Karatacv at 
night; it sometimes made excursions into the 
town but always returned again. Probably it 
had never had an owner, and it still belonged 
to nobody and had no name. The French called 
it Azor; the soldier who told stories called it 
Femgalka; Karataev and others called it Gray, 
or sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a 
name, or even of a breed or any definite color 
did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in 
the least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round 
as a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that 
it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and 
run very easily and quickly on three legs, as if 
disdaining to use all four. Everything pleased 
it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with 
delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful 
air of importance, and now frolic about play- 
ing with a chip of wood or a straw. 

Pierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty 
torn shirt (the only remnant of his former 
clothing), a pair of soldier's trousers which by 



Karatdev's advice he tied with string round the 
ankles for warmth, and a peasant coat and cap. 
Physically he had changed much during this 
time. He no longer seemed stout, though he 
still had the appearanccof solidityandstrength 
hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache 
covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle 
of hair, infested with lice, curled round his head 
like a cap. The look of his eyes was resolute, 
calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. 
The former slackness which had shown itself 
even in his eyes was now replaced by an ener- 
getic readiness for action and resistance. His 
feet were bare. 

Pierre first looked down the field across 
which vehicles and horsemen were passing that 
morning, then into the distance across the riv- 
er, then at the dog who was pretending to be 
in earnest about biting him, and then at his 
bare feet which he placed with pleasure in vari- 
ous positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. 
Every time he looked at his bare feet a smile 
of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his 
face. The sight of them reminded him of all he 
had experienced and learned during these 
weeks and this recollection was pleasant to 
him. 

For some days the weather had been calm 
and clear with slight frosts in the mornings 
what is called an "old wives' summer." 

In the sunshine the air was warm, and that 
warmth was particularly pleasant with the in- 
vigorating freshness of the morning frost still 
in the air. 

On everything far and near lay the magic 
crystal glitter seen only at that tinieof autumn. 
The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance, 
with the village, the church, and the large white 
house. The bare trees, the sand, the bricks and 
roofs of the houses, the green church spire, and 
the corners of the white house in the distance, 
all stood out in the transparent air in most 
delicate outline and with unnatural clearness. 
Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a 
half-burned mansion occupied by the French, 
with lilac bushes still showing dark green be- 
side the fence. And even that ruined and be- 
fouled house which in dull weather was re- 
pulsively ugly- seemed quietly beautiful now, 
in the clear, motionless brilliance. 

A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in 
a homely way, a skullcap on his head, and a 
short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a 
corner of the shed and approached Pierre with 
a friendly wink. 

"What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!" (Their 



576 

name for Pierre.) "Eh? Just like springl" 

And the corporal leaned against the door 
and offered Pierre his pipe, though whenever 
he offered it Pierre always declined it. 

"To be on the march in such weather . . ." 
he began. 

Pierre inquired what was being said about 
leaving, and the corporal told him that nearly 
all the troops were starting and there ought to 
be an order about the prisoners that day. Soko- 
lov, one of the soldiers in the shed with Pierre, 
was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that 
something should be done about him. The 
corporal replied that Pierre need not worry 
about that as they had an ambulance and a 
permanent hospital and arrangements would 
be made for the sick, and that in general every- 
thing that could happen had been foreseen by 
the authorities. 

"Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to 
say a word to the captain, you know. He is a 
man who never forgets anything. Speak to the 
captain when he makes his round, he will do 
anything for you." 

(The captain of whom the corporal spoke 
often had long chats with Pierre and showed 
him all sorts of favors.) 

" 'You see, St. Thomas,' he said to me the 
other day. 'Monsieur Kiril is a man of educa- 
tion, who speaks French. He is a Russian sei- 
gneur who has had misfortunes, but he is a man. 
He knows what's what. ... If he wants any- 
thing and asks me, he won't get a refusal. When 
one has studied, you see, one likes education 
and well-bred people.' It is for your sake I 
mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if 
it had not been for you that affair would have 
ended ill." 

And after chatting a while longer, the cor- 
poral went away. (The affair he had alluded 
to had happened a few days beforea fight be- 
tween the prisoners and the French soldiers, 
in which Pierre had succeeded in pacifying his 
comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had 
heard Pierre talking to the corporal immedi- 
ately asked what the Frenchman had said. While 
Pierre was repeating what he had been told 
about the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, 
tattered French soldier came up to the door of 
the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fin- 
gers to his forehead by way of greeting, he 
asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to 
whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that 
shed. 

A week before the French had had boot 
leather and linen issued to them, which they 



WAR AND PEACE 



had given out to the prisoners to make up into 
boots and shirts for them. 

"Ready, ready, dear fellow!" said Karatdev, 
coming out with a neatly folded shirt. 

Karatdev, on account of the warm weather 
and for convenience at work, was wearing only 
trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. 
His hair was bound round, workman fashion, 
with a wisp of lime-tree bast, and his round 
face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever. 

"A promise is own brother to performance! 
I said Friday and here it is, ready," said Plat6n, 
smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn. 

The Frenchman glanced around uneasily 
and then, as if overcoming his hesitation, rapid- 
ly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. 
He had a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat 
next to his sallow, thin bare body, but no shirt. 
He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking 
on would laugh at him, and thrust his head 
into the shirt hurriedly. None of the prisoners 
said a word. 

"See, it fits well!" Plat6n kept repeating, 
pulling the shirt straight. 

The Frenchman, having pushed his head 
and hands through, without raising his eyes, 
looked down at the shirt and examined the 
seams. 

"You see, dear man, this is not a sewing 
shop, and I had no proper tools; and, as they 
say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse," said 
Plat6n with one of his round smiles, obviously 
pleased with his work. 

"It's good, quite good, thank you," said the 
Frenchman, in French, "but there must be 
some linen left over." 

"It will, fit better still when it sets to your 
body," said Karatdev, still admiring his handi- 
work. "You'll be nice and comfortable. . . ." 

"Thank*s, thanks, old fellow But the bits 

left over?" said the Frenchman again and 
smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note 
and gave it to Karatdev. "But give me the 
pieces that are over." 

Pierre saw that Plat6n did not want to un- 
derstand what the Frenchman was saying, and 
he looked on without interfering. Karatdev 
thanked the Frenchman for the money and 
went on admiring his own work. The French- 
man insisted on having the pieces returned 
that were left over and asked Pierre to trans- 
late what he said. 

"What does he want the bits for?" said Kara- 
tdev. "They'd make fine leg bands for us. Well, 
never mind." 

And Karatdev, with a suddenly changed and 



BOOK THIRTEEN 

saddened expression, took a small bundle of 
scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the 
Frenchman without looking at him. "Oh dear 1" 
muttered Karataev and went away. The French- 
man looked at the linen, considered for a mo- 
ment, then looked inquiringly at Pierre and, 
as if Pierre's look had told him something, sud- 
denly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice: 

"Platoche! Eh, Platochel Keep them your- 
self 1" And handing back the odd bits he turned 
and went out. 

"There, look at that," said Kara tdev, swaying 
his head. "People said they were not Christians, 
but they too have souls. It's what the old folk 
used to say: 'A sweating hand's an open hand, 
a dry hand's close/ He's naked, but yet he's 
given it back." 

Karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent 
awhile looking at the pieces. 

"But they'll make grand leg bands, dear 
friend," he said, and went back into the shed. 



577 



CHAPTER XII 

FOUR WEEKS had passed since Pierre had been 
taken prisoner and though the French had of- 
fered to move him from the men's to the of- 
ficers' shed, he had stayed in the shed where he 
was first put. 

In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre 
experienced almost the extreme limits of pri- 
vation a man can endure; but thanks to his 
physical strength and health, of which he had 
till then been unconscious, and thanks especial- 
ly to the fact that the privations came so 
gradually that it was impossible to say when 
they began, he endured his position not only 
lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he 
obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he 
had formerly striven in vain to reach. He had 
long sought in different ways that tranquillity 
of mind, that inner harmony which had so im- 
pressed him in the soldiers at the battle of Bo- 
rodino. He had sought it in philanthropy, in 
Freemasonry, in the dissipations of town life, 
in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in 
romantic love for Natdsha; he had sought it by 
reasoning and all these quests and experi- 
ments had failed him. And now without think- 
ing about it he had found that peace and in- 
ner harmony only through the horror of death, 
through privation, and through what he rec- 
ognized in Karatdev. 

Those dreadful moments he had lived 
through at the executions had as it were for- 
ever washed away from his imagination and 
memory the agitating thoughts and feelings 



that had formerly seemed so important. It did 
not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the 
war, or politics, or Napoleon. It was plain to 
him that all these things were no business of 
his, and that he was not called on to judge con- 
cerning them and therefore could not do so. 
"Russia and summer weather are not bound 
together," he thought, repeating words of Ka- 
ratacv's which he found strangely consoling. 
His intention of killing Napoleon and his cal- 
culations of the cabalistic number of the beast 
of the Apocalypse now seemed to him mean- 
ingless and even ridiculous. His anger with his 
wife and anxiety that his name should not be 
smirched now seemed not merely trivial but 
even amusing. What concern was it of his that 
somewhere or other that woman was leading 
the life she preferred? What did it matter to 
anybody, and especially to him, whether or not 
they found out that their prisoner's name was 
Count Bezukhov? 

He now often remembered his conversation 
with Prince Andrew and quite agreed with 
him, though he understood Prince Andrew's 
thoughts somewhat differently. Prince Andrew 
had thought and said that happiness could on- 
ly be negative, but had said it with a shade of 
bitterness and irony as though he was really 
saying that all desire for positive happiness is 
implanted in us merely to torment us and nev- 
er be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without 
any mental reservation. The absence of suffer- 
ing, the satisfaction of one's needs and conse- 
quent freedom in the choice of one's occupa- 
tion, that is, of one's way of life, now seemed 
to Pierre to be indubitably man's highest hap- 
piness. Here and now for the first time he fully 
appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he 
wanted to eat, drinking when he wanted to 
drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of 
warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fel- 
low man when he wished to talk and to hear a 
human voice. The satisfaction of one's needs- 
good food, cleanliness, and freedomnow that 
he was deprived of all this, seemed to Pierre to 
constitute perfect happiness; and the choice of 
occupation, that is, of his way of life now that 
that choice was so restricted seemed to him 
such an easy matter that he forgot that a super- 
fluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in 
satisfying one's needs, while great freedom in 
the choice of occupation such freedom as 
his wealth, his education, and his social posi- 
tion had given him in his own life is just 
what makes the choice of occupation in- 
solubly difficult and destroys the desire and 



578 

possibility of having an occupation. 

All Pierre's daydreams now turned on the 
time when he would be free. Yet subsequently, 
and for the rest of his life, he thought and 
spoke with enthusiasm of that month of cap- 
tivity, of those irrecoverable, strong, joyful 
sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace 
of mind and inner freedom which he experi- 
enced only during those weeks. 

When on the first day he got up early, went 
out of the shed at dawn, and saw the cupolas 
and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin 
still dark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty 
grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the wooded banks 
above the winding river vanishing in the pur- 
ple distance, when he felt the contact of the 
fresh air and heard the noise of the crows fly- 
ing from Moscow across the field, and when 
afterwards light gleamed from the east and the 
sun's rim appeared solemnly from behind a 
cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoar- 
frost, the distance and the river, all began to 
sparkle in the glad light Pierre felt a new joy 
and strength in life such as he had never be- 
fore known. And this not only stayed with him 
during the whole of his imprisonment, but 
even grew in strength as the hardships of his 
position increased. 

That feeling of alertness and of readiness for 
anything was still further strengthened in him 
by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed 
of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With 
his knowledge of languages, the respect shown 
him by the French, his simplicity, his readiness 
to give anything asked of him (he received the 
allowance of three rubles a week made to of- 
ficers); with his strength, which he showed to 
the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of 
the hut; his gentleness to his companions, and 
his capacity for sitting still and thinking with- 
out doing anything (which seemed to them in- 
comprehensible), he appeared to them a rather 
mysterious and superior being. The very quali- 
ties that had been a hindrance, if not actually 
harmful, to him in the world he had lived in 
his strength, his disdain for the comforts of 
life, his absent-mindedness and simplicity 
here among these people gave him almost the 
status of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opin- 
ion placed responsibilities upon him. 



CHAPTER XIII 
THE FRENCH EVACUATION began on the night 
between the sixth and seventh of October: 
kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts 
loaded, and troops and baggage trains started. 



WAR AND PEACE 

At seven in the morning a French convoy in 
marching trim, wearing shakos and carrying 
muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood 
in front of the sheds, and animated French talk 
mingled with curses sounded all along the 
lines. 

In the shed everyone was ready, dressed, 
belted, shod, and only awaited the order to 
start. The sick soldier, Sokol6v, pale and thin 
with dark shadows round his eyes, alone sat in 
his place barefoot and not dressed. His eyes, 
prominent from the emaciation of his face, 
gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were 
paying no attention to him, and he moaned 
regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so 
much his sufferings that caused him to moan 
(he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at be- 
ing left alone. 

Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and 
wearing shoes Karatdev had made for him 
from some leather a French soldier had torn 
off a tea chest and brought to have his boots 
mended with, went up to the sick man and 
squatted down beside him. 

"You know, Sokol6v, they are not all going 
away! They have a hospital here. You may be 
better off than we others/' said Pierre. 

"O LordI Oh, it will be the death of me! O 
Lord!" moaned the man in a louder voice. 

"I'll go and ask them again directly," said 
Pierre, rising and going to the door of the shed. 

Just as Pierre reached the door, the corporal 
who had offered him a pipe the day before 
came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal 
and soldiers were in marching kit with knap- 
sacks and shakos that had metal straps, and 
these changed their familiar faces. 

The corporal came, according to orders, to 
shut the door. The prisoners had to be counted 
before being let out. 

"Corporal, what will they do with the sick 
man? . . ." Pierre began. 

But even as he spoke he began to doubt 
whether this was the corporal he knew or a 
stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal 
seem at that moment. Moreover, just as Pierre 
was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was sud- 
denly heard from both sides. The corporal 
frowned at Pierre's wdrds and, uttering some 
meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed 
became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the 
drums on two sides drowned the sick man's 



groans. 

"There it ist . . . It again! . . ." said Pierre to 
himself, and an involuntary shudder ran down 
his spine. In the corporal's changed face, in 



BOOK THIRTEEN 

the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deaf- 
ening noise of the drums, he recognized that 
mysterious, callous force which compelled peo- 
ple against their will to kill their fellow men 
that force the effect of which he had witnessed 
during the executions. To fear or to try to es- 
cape that force, to address entreaties or exhor- 
tations to those who served as its tools, was use- 
less. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait 
and endure. He did not again go to the sick 
man, nor turn to look at him, but stood frown- 
ing by the door of the hut. 

When that door was opened and the pris- 
oners, crowding against one another like a flock 
of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed 
his way forward and approached that very cap- 
tain who as the corporal had assured him was 
ready to do anything for him. The captain was 
also in marching kit, and on his cold face ap- 
peared that same it which Pierre had recog- 
nized in the corporal's words and in the roll of 
the drums. 

"Pass on, pass on I" the captain reiterated, 
frowning sternly, and looking at the prisoners 
who thronged past him. 

Pierre went up to him, though he knew his 
attempt would be vain. 

"What now?" the officer asked with a cold 
look as if not recognizing Pierre. 

Pierre told him about the sick man. 

"He'll manage to walk, devil take him!" said 
the captain. "Pass on, pass onl" he continued 
without looking at Pierre. 

"But he is dying," Pierre again began. 

"Be so good . . ." shouted the captain, frown- 
ing angrily. 

"Dram- da- da- dam, dam-dam . . ." rattled the 
drums, and Pierre understood that this mysteri- 
ous force completely controlled these men and 
that it was now useless to say any more. 

The officer prisoners were separated from the 
soldiers and told to march in front. There were 
about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, 
and about three hundred men. 

The officers, who had come from the other 
sheds, were all strangers to Pierre and much 
better dressed than he. They looked at him 
and at his shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. 
Not far from him walked a fat major with a sal- 
low, bloated, angry face, who was wear ing a Ka- 
zan dressing grown tied round with a towel, 
and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his 
fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which 
he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom 
of his dressing gown and held the stem of his 
pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, 



579 

the major grumbled and growled at everybody 
because hp thought he was being pushed and 
that they were all hurrying when they had no- 
where to hurry to and were -all surprised at 
something when, there was nothing to be sur- 
prised at. Another, a thin little officer, was 
speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they 
were now being taken and how far they would 
get that day. An official in felt boots and wear- 
ing a commissariat uniform ran round from 
side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, 
loudly announcing his observations as to what 
had been burned down and what this or that 
part of the city was that they could see. A third 
officer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed 
with the commissariat officer, arguing that he 
was mistaken in his identification of the differ- 
ent wards of Moscow. 

"What are you disputing about?" said the 
major angrily. "What does it matter whether it 
is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it's burned 
down, and there's an end of it. ... What are 
you pushing for? Isn't the road wide enough?" 
said he, turning to a man behind him who was 
not pushing him at all. 

"Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?" the 
prisoners on one side and another were heard 
saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. "All 
beyond the river, and Zubova, and in the Krm- 
lin. . . . Just look! There's not half of it left. Yes, 
I told you the whole quarter beyond the riv- 
er, and so it is." 

"Well, you know it's burned, so what's the 
use of talking?" said the major. 

As they passed near a church in the Kham6v- 
niki (one of the few unburned quarters of 
Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly 
started to one side and exclamations of horror 
and disgust were heard. 

"Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, 
dead, so he is. ... And smeared with some- 
thing!" 

Pierre too drew near the church where the 
thing was that evoked these exclamations, and 
dimly made out something leaning against the 
palings surrounding the church. From the 
words of his comrades who saw better than he 
did, he found that this was the body of a man, 
set upright against the palings with its face 
smeared with soot. 

"Go on! What the devil ... Go on! Thirty 
thousand devils! ..." the convoy guards began 
cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh 
virulence, drove away with their swords the 
crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead 
man.

WAR AND PEACE 



CHAPTER XIV 

THROUGH THE CROSS STREETS of the Khamovni- 
ki quarter the prisoners marched, followed 
only by their escort and the vehicles and wag- 
ons belonging to that escort, but when they 
reached the supply stores they came among a 
huge and closely packed train of artillery min- 
gled with private vehicles. 

At the bridge they all halted, waiting for 
those in front to get across. From the bridge 
they had a view of endless lines of moving bag- 
gage trains before and behind them. To the 
right, where the Kaluga road turns near Nes- 
kuchny, endless rows of troops and carts 
stretched away into the distance. These were 
troops of Beauharnais' corps which had start- 
ed before any of the others. Behind, along the 
riverside and across the Stone Bridge, were 
Ney's troops and transport. 

Davout's troops, in whose charge were the 
prisoners, were crossing the Crimean bridge 
and some were already debouching into the 
Kaluga road. But the baggage trains stretched 
out so that the last of Beauharnais' train had 
not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Ka- 
luga road when the vanguard of Ney's army 
was already emerging from the Great Ordy nka 
Street. 

When they had crossed the Crimean bridge 
the prisoners moved a few steps forward, halt- 
ed, and again moved on, and from all sides ve- 
hicles and men crowded closer and closer to- 
gether. They advanced the few hundred paces 
that separated the bridge from the Kaluga 
road, taking more than an hour to do so, and 
came out upon the square where the streets of 
the Transmoskvd. ward and the Kaluga road 
converge, and the prisoners jammed close to- 
gether had to stand for some hours at that cross- 
way. From all sides, like the roar of the sea, 
were heard the rattle of wheels, the tramp of 
feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. 
Pierre stood pressed against the wall of a 
charred house, listening to that noise which 
mingled in his imagination with the roll of 
the drums. 

To get a better view, several officer prisoners 
climbed onto the wall of the half-burned house 
against which Pierre was leaning. 

"What crowds! Just look at the crowds! . . . 
They've loaded goods even on the cannon! 
Look there, those are furs!" they exclaimed. 
"Just see what the blackguards have looted. . . . 
There! See what that one has behind in the 
cart. . . . Why, those are settings taken from 
some icons, by heaven! . . . Oh, the rascals! . . . 



See how that fellow has loaded himself up, he 
can hardly walk! Good lord, they've even 
grabbed those chaises! ... See that fellow there 
sitting on the trunks. . . . Heavens! They're 
fighting." 

"That's right, hit him on the snout on his 
snout! Like this, we shan't get away before 
evening. Look, look there. . . . Why, that must 
be Napoleon's own. See what horses! And the 
monograms with a crown! It's like a portable 
house. . . . That fellow's dropped his sack and 
doesn't see it. Fighting again ... A woman 
with a baby, and not bad-looking either! Yes, 
I dare say, that's the way they'll let you pass. 
. . . Just look, there's no end to it. Russian 
wenches, by heaven, so they are! In carriages 
see how comfortably they've settled them- 
selves!" 

Again, as at the church in Kham6vniki, a 
wave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners 
forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to 
his stature, saw over the heads of the others 
what so attracted their curiosity. In three car- 
riages involved among the munition carts, close- 
ly squeezed together, sat women with rouged 
faces, dressed in glaring colors, who were shout- 
ing something in shrill voices. 

From the moment Pierre had recognized the 
appcaranceof themysterious force nothing had 
seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the 
corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these 
women hurrying away nor the burned ruihs of 
Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely 
made an impression on him as if his soul, 
making ready for a hard struggle, refused to re- 
ceive impressions that might weaken it. 

The women's vehicles drove by. Behind them 
came more carts, soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun 
carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts, 
more soldiers, and now and then women, 

Pierre did not see the people as individuals 
but saw their movement. 

All these people and horses seemed driven 
forward by some invisible power. During the 
hour Pierre watched them they all came flow- 
ing from the different streets with one and the 
same desire to get on quickly; they all jostled 
one another, began to grow angry and to fight, 
white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the 
same words of abuse flew from side to side, and 
all the faces bore the same swaggeringly reso- 
lute and coldly cruel expression that had struck 
Pierre thatmorningon the corporal's face when 
the drums were beating. 

It was not till nearly evening that the officer 
commanding the escort collected his men and 



BOOK THIRTEEN 



581 



with shouts and quarrels forced his way in 
among the baggage trains, and the prisoners, 
hemmed in on all sides, emerged onto the Ka- 
luga road. 

They marched very quickly, without resting, 
and halted only when the sun began to set. 
The baggage carts drew up close together and 
the men began to prepare for their night's rest. 
They all appeared angry and dissatisfied. For 
a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting 
could be heard from all sides. A carriage that 
followed the escort ran into one of the carts 
and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several 
soldiers ran toward the cart from different 
sides: some beat the carriage horses on their 
heads, turning them aside, others fought 
among themselves, and Pierre saw that one 
German was badly wounded on the head by a 
sword. 

It seemed that all these men, now that they 
had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of 
the autumn evening, experienced one and the 
same feeling of unpleasant awakening from 
the hurry and eagerness to push on that had 
seized them at the start. Once at a standstill 
they all seemed to understand that they did not 
yet know where they were going, and that much 
that was painful and difficult awaited them on 
this journey. 

During this halt the escort treated the pris- 
oners even worse than they had done at the 
start. It was here that the prisoners for the first 
time received horseflesh for their meat ration. 

From the officer down to the lowest soldier 
they all showed what seemed like personal spite 
against each of the prisoners, in unexpected 
contrast to their former friendly relations. 

This spite increased still more when, on call- 
ing over the roll of prisoners, it was found that 
in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian 
soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, 
had escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a 
Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far 
from the road, and heard his friend the cap- 
tain reprimand and threaten to court-martial 
a noncommissioned officer on account of the 
escape of the Russian. To the noncommissioned 
officer's excuse that the prisoner was ill and 
could not walk, the officer replied that the or- 
der was to shoot those who lagged behind. 
Pierre felt that that fatal force which had 
crushed him during the executions, but which 
he had not felt during his imprisonment, now 
again controlled his existence. It was terrible, 
but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of 
that fatal force to crush him, there grew and 



strengthened in his soul a power of life inde- 
pendent of it. 

He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with 
horseflesh and chatted with his comrades. 

Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke 
of what they had seen in Moscow, or of the 
roughness of their treatment by the French, or 
of the order to shoot them which had been an- 
nounced to them. As if in reaction against the 
worsening of their position they were all par- 
ticularly animated and gay. They spoke of per- 
sonal reminiscences, of amusing scenes they 
had witnessed during the campaign, and avoid- 
ed all talk of their present situation. 

The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone 
out here and there in the sky. A red glow as of 
a conflagration spread above the horizon from 
the rising full moon, and that vast red ball 
swayed strangely in the gray haze. It grew light. 
The evening was ending, but the night had not 
yet come. Pierre got up and left his new com- 
panions, crossing between the campfires to the 
other side of the road where he had been told 
the common soldier prisoners were stationed. 
He wanted to talk to them. On the road he was 
stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him 
back. 

Pierre turned back, not to his companions by 
the campfire, but to an unharnessed cart 
where there was nobody. Tucking his legs un- 
der him and dropping his head he sat down on 
the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and 
remained motionless a long while sunk in 
thought. Suddenly he burst out into a fit of his 
broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that 
men from various sides turned with surprise 
to see what this strange and evidently solitary 
laughter could mean. 

"Ha-ha-ha!" laughed Pierre. And he said 
aloud to himself: "The soldier did not let me 
pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold 
me captive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? 
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! . . ." and he laughed till 
tears started to his eyes. 

A man got up and came to see what this 
queer big fellow was laughing at all by him- 
self. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went 
farther away from the inquisitive man, and 
looked around him. 

The huge, endless bivouac that had previ- 
ously resounded with the cracklingof campfires 
and the voices of many men had grown quiet, 
the red campfires were growing paler and dy- 
ing down. High up in the light sky hung the 
full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, 
unseen before, were now visible in the dis- 



582 

tance. And farther still, beyond those forests 
and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless dis- 
tance lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at 
the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway 
depths. "And all that is me, all that is within 
me, and it is all II" thought Pierre. "And they 
caught all that and put it into a shed boarded 
up with planks!" He smiled, and went and 
lay down to sleep beside his companions. 

CHAPTER XV 

IN THE EARLY DAYS of October another envoy 
came to Kutuzov with a letter from Napoleon 
proposing peace and falsely dated from Mos- 
cow, though Napoleon was already not far 
from Kutuzov on the old Kaluga road. Kutu- 
zov replied to this letter as he had done to the 
one formerly brought by Lauriston, saying that 
there could be no question of peace. 

Soon after that a report was received from 
D6rokhov's guerrilla detachment operating to 
the left of Tariitino that troops of Broussier's 
division had been seen at Forminsk and that 
being separated from the rest of the French 
army they might easily be destroyed. The 
soldiers and officers again demanded action. 
Generals on the staff, excited by the memory 
of the easy victory at Tanitino, urged Kutuzov 
to carry out Dorokhov's suggestion. Kutuzov 
did not consider any offensive necessary. The 
result was a compromise which was inevitable: 
a small detachment was sent to Formfnsk to 
attack Broussier. 

By a strange coincidence, this task, which 
turned out to be a most difficult and important 
one, was entrusted to Dokhtiirov that same 
modest little Dokhtiirov whom no one had de- 
scribed to us as drawing up plans of 'battles, 
dashing about in front of regiments, shower- 
ing crosses on batteries, and so on, and who 
was thought to be and was spoken of as un- 
decided and undiscerning but whom we find 
commanding wherever the position was most 
difficult all through the Russo-French wars 
from Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz 
he remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying 
the regiments, saving what was possible when 
all were flying and perishing and not a single 
general was left in the rearguard. Ill with fever 
he went to Smolensk with twenty thousand 
men to defend the town against Napoleon's 
whole army. In Smolensk, at the Maldkhov 
Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of 
fever before he was awakened by the bombard- 
ment of the town and Smolensk held out all 
day long. At the battle of Borodin6, when 



WAR AND PEACE 

Bagrati6n was killed and nine tenths of the 
men of our left flank had fallen and the full 
force of the French artillery fire was directed 
against it, the man sent there was this same 
irresolute and undiscerning Dokhtiirov Kut- 
uzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had 
made by sending someone else there first. And 
the quiet little Dokhtiirov rode thither, and 
Borodin6 became the greatest glory of the 
Russian army. Many heroes have been de- 
scribed to us in verse and prose, but of Dokh- 
tiirov scarcely a word has been said. 

It was Dokhtiirov again whom they sent to 
Formfnsk and from there to Mdlo-Yarosldvets, 
the place where the last battle with the French 
was fought and where the obvious disintegra- 
tion of the French army began; and we are 
told of many geniuses and heroes of that 
period of the campaign, but of Dokhtiirov 
nothing or very little is said and that dubi- 
ously. And this silence about Dokhtiirov is the 
clearest testimony to his merit. 

It is natural for a man who docs not under- 
stand the workings of a machine to imagine 
that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance 
and is interfering with its action and tossing 
about in it is its most important part. The man 
who does not understand the construction of 
the machine cannot conceive that the small 
connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is 
one of the most essential parts of the machine, 
and not the shaving which merely harms and 
hinders the working. 

On the tenth of October when Dokhtiirov 
had gone halfway to Forminsk and stopped at 
the village of Arist6vo, preparing faithfully to 
execute the orders he had received, the whole 
French army having, in its convulsive move- 
ment, reached Murat's position apparently in 
order to give battle suddenly without any 
reason turned off to the left onto the new 
Kaluga road and began to enter Formfnsk, 
where only Broussier had been till then. At 
that time Dokhtiirov had under his command, 
besides D6rokhov's detachment, the two small 
guerrilla detachments of Figner and Sesldvin. 

On the evening of October 1 1 Seslvin came 
to the Arist6vo headquarters with a French 
guardsman he had captured. The prisoner 
said that the troops that had entered Formfnsk 
that day were the vanguard of the whole army, 
that Napoleon was there and the whole army 
had left Moscow four days previously. That 
same evening a house serf who had come from 
Borovsk said he had seen an immense army 
entering the town. Some Cossacks of Dokhtii- 



BOOK THIRTEEN 

rov's detachment reported having sighted the 
French Guards marching along the road to 
B6rovsk. From all these reports it was evident 
that where they had expected to meet a single 
division there was now the whole French army 
marching from Moscow in an unexpected di- 
rectionalong the Kaluga road. Dokhturov 
was unwilling to undertake any action, as it 
was not clear to him now what he ought to do. 
He had been ordered to attack Formfnsk. But 
only Broussier had been there at that time and 
now the whole French army was there. Erm6- 
lov wished to act on his own judgment, but 
Dokhturov insisted that he must have Kutii- 
zov's instructions. So it was decided to send a 
dispatch to the staff. 

For this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovf- 
tinov, was chosen, who was to explain the 
whole affair by word of mouth, besides deliver- 
ing a written report. Toward midnight Bolk- 
hovitinov, having received the dispatch and 
verbal instructions, galloped off to the General 
Staff accompanied by a Cossack with spare 
horses. 



583 



CHAPTER XVI 

IT WAS a warm, dark, autumn night. It had 
been raining for four days. Having changed 
horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an 
hour and a half over a sticky, muddy road, 
Bolkhovitinov reached Litashevka after one 
o'clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on 
whose wattle fence hung a signboard, GENERAL 
STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he en- 
tered a dark passage. 

"The general on duty, quickl It's very im- 
portant!" said he to someone who had risen 
and was sniffing in the dark passage. 

"He has been very unwell since the evening 
and this is the third night he has not slept," 
said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. "You 
should wake the captain first." 

"But this is very important, from General 
Dokhturov," said Bolkhovitinov, entering the 
open door which he had found by feeling in 
the dark. 

The orderly had gone in before him and 
began waking somebody. 

"Your honor, your honor! A courier." 

"What? What's that? From whom?" came a 
sleepy voice. 

"From Dokhturov and from Alexdy Petr6- 
vich. Napoleon is at Forminsk," said Bolkhovl- 
tinov, unable to see in the dark who was speak- 
ing but guessing by the voice that it was not 
Konovnitsyn. 



The man who had wakened yawned and 
stretched himself. 

"I don't like waking him/ 1 he said, fumbling 
for something. "He is very ill. Perhaps this is 
only a rumor." 

"Here is the dispatch," said Bolkhovitinov. 
"My orders are to give it at once to the gen- 
eral on duty." 

"Wait a moment, I'll light a candle. You 
damned rascal, where do you always hide it?" 
said the voice of the man who was stretching 
himself, to the orderly. (This was Shcherbinin, 
Konovnitsyn's adjutant.) "I've found it, I've 
found itl" he added. 

The orderly was striking a light and Shcher- 
bfnin was fumbling for something on the 
candlestick. 

"Oh, the nasty beasts!" said he with disgust. 

By the light of the sparks Bolkhovftinov saw 
Shcherbinin's youthful face as he held the 
candle, and the face of another man who was 
still asleep. This was Konovnitsyn. 

When the flame of the sulphur splinters 
kindled by the tinder burned up, first blue and 
then red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle, 
from the candlestick of which the cockroaches 
that had been gnawing it were running away, 
and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovitinov 
was bespattered all over with mud and had 
smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve. 

"Who gave the report?" inquired Shchfer- 
binin, taking the envelope. 

"The news is reliable," said Bolkhovitinov. 
"Prisoners, Cossacks, and the scouts all say the 
same thing." 

"There's nothing to be done, we'll have to 
wake him," said Shcherbinin, rising and going 
up to the man in the nightcap who lay cov- 
ered by a greatcoat. "Peter PetrovichI" said he. 
(Konovnftsyn did not stir.) "To the General 
Staff!" he said with a smile, knowing that those 
words would be sure to arouse him. 

And in fact the head in the nightcap was 
lifted at once. On Konovnitsyn's handsome, 
resolute face with checks flushed by fever, 
there still remained for an instant a faraway 
dreamy expression remote from present af- 
fairs, but then he suddenly started and his 
face assumed its habitual calm and firm ap- 
pearance. 

"Well, what is it? From whom?" he asked 
immediately but without hurry, blinking at 
the light. 

While listening to theofficer's report Konov- 
nftsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch. 
Hardly had he done so before he lowered his 



WAR AND PEACE 



legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen 
floor and began putting on his boots. Then he 
took off his nightcap, combed his hair over 
his temples, and donned his cap. 

"Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his 
Highness." 

Konovnftsyn had understood at once that 
the news brought was of great importance and 
that no time must be lost. He did not consider 
or ask himself whether the news was good or 
bad. That did not interest him. He regarded 
the whole business of the war not with his 
intelligence or his reason but by something 
else. There was within him a deep unex- 
pressed conviction that all would be well, but 
that one must not trust to this and still less 
speak about it, but must only attend to one's 
own work. And he did his work, giving his 
whole strength to the task. 

Peter Petr6vich Konovnftsyn, like Dokhtu- 
rov, seems to have been included merely for 
propriety's sake in the list of the so-called 
heroes of 1812 the Barclays, Ra^vskis, Erm6- 
lovs, Pldtovs, and Milordoviches. Like Dokh- 
turov he had the reputation of being a man 
of very limited capacity and information, and 
like Dokhturov he never made plans of battle 
but was always found where the situation was 
most difficult. Since his appointment as gen- 
eral on duty he had always slept with his door 
open, giving orders that every messenger 
should be allowed to wake him up. In battle 
he was always under fire, so that Kutuzov re- 
proved him for it and feared to send him to 
the front, and like Dokhturov he was one of 
those unnoticed cogwheels that, without clat- 
ter or noise, constitute the most essential part 
of the machine. 

Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark 
night Konovnitsyn frowned partly from an 
increased pain in his head and partly at the 
unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of 
how all that nest of influential men on the 
staff would be stirred up by this news, espe- 
cially Bennigsen, who ever since Tariitino had 
been at daggers drawn with Kutuzov; and how 
they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue 
orders, and rescind them. And this premoni- 
tion was disagreeable to him though he knew 
it could not be helped. 

And in fact Toll, to whom he went to com- 
municate the news, immediately began to ex- 
pound his plans to a general sharing his quar- 
ters, until Konovnftsyn, who listened in weary 
silence, reminded him that they must go to 
see his Highness. 



CHAPTER XVII 

Kurtizov like all old people did not sleep 
much at night. He often fell asleep unex- 
pectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying 
on his bed without undressing, he generally 
remained awake thinking. 

So he lay now on his bed, supporting his 
large, heavy, scarred head on his plump hand, 
with his one eye open, meditating and peer- 
ing into the darkness. 

Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with 
the Emperor and had more influence than 
anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid 
him, Kutuzov was more at ease as to the pos- 
sibility of himself and his troops being obliged 
to take part in useless aggressive movements. 
The lesson of the Tariitino battle and of the 
day before it, which Kutuzov remembered 
with pain, must, he thought, have some effect 
on others too. 

"They must understand that we can only 
lose by taking the offensive. Patience and time 
are my warriors, my champions," thought 
Kutuzov. He knew that an apple should not 
be plucked while it is green. It will fall of it- 
self when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple 
is spoiled, the tree is harmed, and your teeth 
are set on edge. Like an experienced sports- 
man he knew that the beast was wounded, and 
wounded as only the whole strength of Russia 
could have wounded it, but whether it was 
mortally wounded or not was still an unde- 
cided question. Now by the fact of Lauriston 
and BarthtHemi having been sent, and by the 
reports of the guerrillas, Kutuzov was almost 
sure that the wound was mortal. But he needed 
further proofs and it was necessary to wait. 

"They want to run to see how they have 
wounded it. Wait and we shall see! Continual 
maneuvers, continual advances!" thought he. 
"What for? Only to distinguish themselves! 
As if fighting were fun. They are like children 
from whom one can't get any sensible account 
of what has happened because they all want 
to show how well they can fight. But that's 
not what is needed now. 

"And what ingenious maneuvers they all 
propose to me! It seems to them that when 
they have thought of two or three contin- 
gencies" (he remembered the general plan 
sent him from Petersburg) "they have fore- 
seen everything. But the contingencies are 
endless." 

The undecided question as to whether the 
wound inflicted at Borodin6 was mortal or not 
had hung over Kutuzov's head for a whole 



month. On the one hand the French had oc- 
cupied Moscow. On the other Kutiizov felt 
assured with all his being that the terrible 
blow into which he and all the Russians had 
put their whole strength must have been mor- 
tal. But in any case proofs were needed; he 
had waited a whole month for them and grew 
more impatient the longer he waited. Lying 
on his bed during those sleepless nights he did 
just what he reproached those younger gen- 
erals for doing. He imagined all sorts of pos- 
sible contingencies, just like the younger men, 
but with this difference, that he saw thousands 
of contingencies instead of two or three and 
based nothing on them. The longer he 
thought the more contingencies presented 
themselves. He imagined all sorts of move- 
ments of the Napoleonic army as a whole or 
in sections against Petersburg, or against 
him, or to outflank him. He thought too of 
the possibility (which he feared most of all) 
that Napoleon might fight him with his own 
weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. 
Kutuzov even imagined that Napoleon's army 
might turn back through Medyn and Yukh- 
nov, but the one thing he could not foresee 
was what happenedthe insane, convulsive 
stampede of Napoleon's army during its first 
eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede 
which made possible what Kutuzov had not 
yet even dared to think of the complete ex- 
termination of the French. Dorokhov's report 
about Broussier's division, the guerrillas' re- 
ports of distress in Napoleon's army, rumors 
of preparations for leaving Moscow, all con- 
firmed the supposition that the French army 
was beaten and preparing for flight. But these 
were only suppositions, which seemed im- 
portant to the younger men but not to Kutu- 
zov. With his sixty years' experience he knew 
what value to attach to rumors, knew how apt 
people who desire anything are to group all 
news so that it appears to confirm what they 
desire, and he knew how readily in such cases 
they omit all that makes for the contrary. And 
the more he desired it the less he allowed him- 
self to believe it. This question absorbed all 
his mental powers. All else was to him only 
life's customary routine. To such customary 
routine belonged his conversations with the 
staff, the letters he wrote from Tarutino to 
Madame de Stael, the reading of novels, the 
distribution of awards, his correspondence 
with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruc- 
tion of the French, which he alone foresaw, 
was his heart's one desire. 



BOOK THIRTEEN 585 

On the night of the eleventh of October he 
lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that. 

There was a stir in the next room and he 
heard the steps of Toll, Konovnitsyn, and 
Bolkhovftinov. 

"Eh, who's there? Come in, come in I What 
news?" the field marshal called out to them. 

While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll 
communicated the substance of the news. 

"Who brought it?" asked Kutuzov with a 
look which, when the candle was lit, struck 
Toll by its cold severity. 

"There can be no doubt about it, your High- 
ness." 

"Call him in, call him here." 

Kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down 
from the bed and his big paunch resting 
against the other which was doubled under 
him. He screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize 
the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to 
read in his face what preoccupied his own 
mind. 

"Tell me, tell me, friend," said he to Bolk- 
hovitinov in his low, aged voice, as he pulled 
together the shirt which gaped open on his 
chest, "come nearer nearer. What news have 
you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon has left 
Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?" 

Bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from 
the beginning of all he had been told to re- 
port. 

"Speak quicker, quicker! Don't torture 
me!" Kutuzov interrupted him. 

Bolkhovitinov told him everything and was 
then silent, awaiting instructions. Toll was be- 
ginning to say something but Kutuzov check- 
ed him. He tried to say something, but his face 
suddenly puckered and wrinkled; he waved 
his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side 
of the room, to the corner darkened by the 
icons that hung there. 

"O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our 
prayer . . ." said he in a tremulous voice with 
folded hands. "Russia is saved. I thank Thee, 
O Lord!" and he wept. 



CHAPTER XV11I 

FROM THE TIME he received this news to the 
end of the campaign all Kutuzov's activity 
was directed toward restraining his troops, by 
authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from use- 
less attacks, maneuvers, or encounters with 
the perishing enemy. Dokhtiirov went to 
Mlo-Yarosldvets, but Kuti'izov lingered with 
the main army and gave orders for the evacua- 
tion of Kaluga a retreat beyond which town 



586 

seemed to him quite possible* 

Everywhere Kuttizov retreated, but the en- 
emy without waiting for his retreat fled in the 
opposite direction. 

Napoleon's historians describe to us his 
skilled maneuvers at Tarutino and Malo- 
Yaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what 
would have happened had Napoleon been in 
time to penetrate into the rich southern prov- 
inces. 

But not to speak of the fact that nothing 
prevented him from advancing into those 
southern provinces (for the Russian army did 
not bar his way), the historians forget that 
nothing could have saved his army, for then 
already it bore within itself the germs of in- 
evitable ruin. How could that army which 
had found abundant supplies in Moscow and 
had trampled them underfoot instead of keep- 
ing them, and on arriving at Smolensk had 
looted provisions instead of storing them 
how could that army recuperate in Kaluga 
province, which was inhabited by Russians 
such as those who lived in Moscow, and where 
fire had the same property of consuming what 
was set ablaze? 

That army could not recover anywhere. 
Since the battle of Borodin6 and the pillage of 
Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, 
the chemical elements of dissolution. 

The members of what had once been an 
army Napoleon himself and all his soldiers- 
fled without knowing whither, each concerned 
only to make his escape as quickly as possible 
from this position, of the hopelessness of 
which they were all more or less vaguely con- 
scious. 

So it came about that at the council at 
Malo-Yaroslavets, when the generals pretend- 
ing to confer together expressed various opin- 
ions, all mouths were closed by the opinion 
uttered by the simple-minded soldier Mouton 
who, speaking last, said what they all felt: 
that the one thing needful was to get away as 
quickly as possible; and no one, not even 
Napoleon, could say anything against that 
truth which they all recognized. 

But though they all realized that it was 
necessary to get away, there still remained a 
feeling of shame at admitting that they must 
flee. An external shock was needed to over- 
come that shame, and this shock came in due 
time. It was what the French called "le hourra 
de I'Empereur" 1 

1 Hourra was the cheer the Russian troops gave 
when charging the enemy. TR. 



WAR AND PEACE 

The day after the council at Mdlo-Yarosla- 
vets Napoleon rode out early in the morning 
amid the lines of his army with his suite of 
marshals and an escort, on the pretext of in- 
specting the army and the scene of the pre- 
vious and of the impending battle. Some Cos- 
sacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the 
Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the 
Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what 
saved him was the very thing that was destroy- 
ing the French army, the booty on which the 
Cossacks fell. Here as at Tanitino they went 
after plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding 
Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and 
Napoleon managed to escape. 

When les enfants du Don might so easily 
have taken the Emperor himself in the midst 
of his army, it was clear that there was nothing 
for it but to fly as fast as possible along the 
nearest, familiar road. Napoleon with his 
forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, 
not feeling his former agility and boldness, 
and under the influence of the fright the Cos- 
sacks had given him he at once agreed with 
Mouton and issued orders as the historians 
tell us to retreat by the Smolensk road. 

That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and 
that the army retreated, does not prove that 
Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the 
forces which influenced the whole army and 
directed it along the Mozhdysk (that is, the 
Smolensk) road acted simultaneously on him 
also. 

CHAPTER XIX 

A MAN IN MOTION always devises an aim for 
that motion. To be able to go a thousand miles 
he must imagine that something good awaits 
him at the end of those thousand miles. One 
must have the prospect of a promised land to 
have the strength to move. 

The promised land for the French during 
their advance had been Moscow, during their 
retreat it was their native land. But that native 
land was too far off, and for a man going a 
thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to 
set aside his final goal and to say to himself: 
"Today I shall get to a place twenty-five miles 
off where I shall rest and spend the night," 
and during the first day's journey that resting 
place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts 
all his hopes and desires. And the impulses 
felt by a single person are always magnified 
in a crowd. 

For the French retreating along the old 
Smolensk road, the final goal their native 



BOOK THIRTEEN 



58? 



land was too remote, and their immediate 
goal was Smolensk, toward which all their 
desires and hopes, enormously intensified in 
the mass, urged them on. It was not that they 
knew that much food and fresh troops await- 
ed them in Smolensk, nor that they were told 
so (on the contrary their superior officers, and 
Napoleon himself, knew that provisions were 
scarce there), but because this alone could give 
them strength to move on and endure their 
present privations. So both those who knew 
and those who did not know deceived them- 
selves, and pushed on to Smolensk as to a 
promised land. 

Coming out onto the highroad the French 
fled with surprising energy and unheard-of 
rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. 
Besides the common impulse which bound 
the whole crowd of French into one mass and 
supplied them with a certain energy, there was 
another cause binding them together their 
great numbers. As with the physical law of 
gravity, their enormous mass drew the individ- 
ual human atoms to itself. In their hundreds 
of thousands they moved like a whole nation. 

Each of them desired nothing more than 
to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from 
all this horror and misery; but on the one 
hand the force of this common attraction to 
Smolensk, their goal, drew each of them in 
the same direction; on the other hand an 
army corps could not surrender to a company, 
and though the French availed themselves of 
every convenient opportunity to detach them- 
selves and to surrender on the slightest decent 
pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. 
Their very numbers and their crowded and 
swift movement deprived them of that possi- 
bility and rendered it not only difficult but 
impossible for the Russians to stop this move- 
ment, to which the French were directing all 
their energies. Beyond a certain limit no me- 
chanical disruption of the body could hasten 
the process of decomposition. 

A lump of snow cannot be melted instan- 



taneously. There is a certain limit of time in 
less than which no amount of heat can melt 
the snow. On the contrary the greater the heat 
the more solidified the remaining snow be- 
comes. 

Of the Russian commanders Kutuzov alone 
understood this. When the flight of the French 
army along the Smolensk road became well de- 
fined, what Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the 
night of the eleventh of October began to oc- 
cur. The superior officers all wanted to dis- 
tinguish themselves, to cut off, to seize, to 
capture, and to overthrow the French, and all 
clamored for action. 

Kutuzov alone used all his power (and such 
power is very limited in the case of any com- 
mander in chief) to prevent an attack. 

He could not tell them what we say now: 
"Why fight, why block the road, losing our 
own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfor- 
tunate wretches? What is the use of that, when 
a third of their army has melted away on the 
road from Moscow to Vydzma without any 
battle?" But drawing from his aged wisdom 
what they could understand, he told them of 
the golden bridge, and they laughed at and 
slandered him, flinging themselves on, rend- 
ing and exulting over the dying beast. 

Erm61ov, Milorddovich, Pldtov, and others 
in proximity to the French near Vydzma could 
not resist their desire to cut off and break up 
two French corps, and by way of reporting 
their intention to Kutuzov they sent him a 
blank sheet of paper in an envelope. 

And try as Kutuzov might to restrain the 
troops, our men attacked, trying to bar the 
road. Infantry regiments, we are told, ad- 
vanced to the attack with music and with 
drums beating, and killed and lost thousands 
of men. 

But they did not cut off or overthrow any- 
body and the French army, closing up more 
firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily 
melting away, to pursue its fatal path to Smo- 
tensk. 



Book Fourteen: 1812 



CHAPTER I 

THE BATTLE OF BoRODiN6, with the occupation 
of Moscow that followed it and the flight of 
the French without further conflicts, is one of 
the most instructive phenomena in history. 

All historians agree that the external activ- 
ity of states and nations in their conflicts with 
one another is expressed in wars, and that as 
a direct result of greater or less success in war 
the political strength of states and nations in- 
creases or decreases. 

Strange as may be the historical account of 
how some king or emperor, having quarreled 
with another, collects an army, fights his 
enemy's army, gains a victory by killing three, 
five, or ten thousand men, and subjugates a 
kingdom and an entire nation of several mil- 
lions, all the facts of history (as far as we know 
it) confirm the truth of the statement that the 
greater or lesser success of one army against 
another is the cause, or at least an essential 
indication, of an increase or decrease in the 
strength of the nation even though it is un- 
intelligible why the defeat of an army a 
hundredth part of a nation should oblige 
that whole nation to submit. An army gains a 
victory, and at once the rights of the conquer- 
ing nation have increased to the detriment of 
the defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and 
at once a people loses its rights in proportion 
to the severity of the reverse, and if its army 
suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite 
subjugated. 

So according to history it has been found 
from the most ancient times, and so it is to our 
own day. All Napoleon's wars serve to confirm 
this rule. In proportion to the defeat of the 
Austrian army Austria loses its rights, and the 
rights and the strength of France increase. 
The victories of the French at Jena and Auer- 
stadt destroy the independent existence of 
Prussia. 

But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory 
near Moscow. Moscow is taken and after that, 
with no further battles, it is not Russia that 



ceases to exist, but the French army of six 
hundred thousand, and then Napoleonic 
France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules 
of history: to say that the field of battle at 
Borodino remained in the hands of the Rus- 
sians, or that after Moscow there were other 
battles that destroyed Napoleon's army, is im- 
possible. 

After the French victory at Borodin6 there 
was no general engagement nor any that were 
at all serious, yet the French army ceased to 
exist. What does this mean? If it were an ex- 
ample taken from the history of China, we 
might say that it was not an historic phenom- 
enon (which is the historians' usual expedient 
when anything does not fit their standards); 
if the matter concerned some brief conflict in 
which only a small number of troops took 
part, we might treat it as an exception; but 
this event occurred before our fathers' eyes, 
and for them it was a question of the life or 
death of their fatherland, and it happened in 
the greatest of all known wars. 

The period of the campaign of 1812 from 
the battle of Borodino to the expulsion of the 
French proved that the winning of a battle 
does not produce a conquest and is not even 
an invariable indication of conquest; it proved 
that the force which decides the fate of peoples 
lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies 
and battles, but in something else. 

The French historians, describing the con- 
dition of the French army before it left Mos- 
cow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand 
Army, except the cavalry, the artillery, and the 
transport there was no forage for the horses 
or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one 
could remedy, for the peasants of the district 
burned their hay rather than let the French 
have it. 

The victory gained did not bring the usual 
results because the peasants Karp and Vlas 
(who after the French had evacuated Moscow 
drove in their carts to pillage the town, and 
in general personally failed to manifest any 



BOOK FOURTEEN 



heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable 
multitude of such peasants, did not bring 
their hay to Moscow for the high price offered 
them, but burned it instead. 

Let us imagine two men who have come out 
to fight a duel with rapiers according to all 
the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has 
gone on for some time; suddenly one of the 
combatants, feeling himself wounded and 
understanding that the matter is no joke but 
concerns his life, throws down his rapier, 
and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand 
begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that 
the combatant who so sensibly employed the 
best and simplest means to attain his end was 
at the same time influenced by traditions of 
chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of 
the case, insisted that he had gained his vic- 
tory with the rapier according to all the rules 
of art. One can imagine what confusion and 
obscurity would result from such an account 
of the duel. 

The fencer who demanded a contest accord- 
ing to the rules of fencing was the French 
army; his opponent who threw away the rapier 
and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian 
people; those who try to explain the matter 
according to the rules of fencing are the his- 
torians who have described the event. 

After the burning of Smolensk a war began 
which did not follow any previous traditions 
of war. The burning of towns and villages, the 
retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Boro- 
din6 and the renewed retreat, the burning of 
Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure 
of transports, and the guerrilla war were all de- 
partures from the rules. 

Napoleon felt this, and from the time he 
took up the correct fencing attitude in Moscow 
and instead of his opponent's rapier saw a 
cudgel raised above his head, he did not cease 
to complain to Kutuzov and to the Emperor 
Alexander that the war was being carried on 
contrary to all the rules as if there were any 
rules for killing people. In spite of the com- 
plaints of the French as to the nonobservance 
of the rules, in spite of the fact that to some 
highly placed Russians it seemed rather dis- 
graceful to fight widi a cudgel and they wanted 
to assume a pose en quarie or en tierce accord- 
ing to all the rules, and to make an adroit 
thrust en prime, and so on the cudgel of the 
people's war was lifted with all its menacing 
and majestic strength, and without consulting 
anyone's tastes or rules and regardless of any- 
thing else, it rose and fell with stupid simplic- 



589 



ity, but consistently, and belabored the French 
till the whole invasion had perished. 

And it is well for a people who do not as 
the French did in 1813 salute according to all 
the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their 
rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their 
magnanimous conqueror, but at the moment 
of trial, without asking what rules others have 
adopted in similar cases, simply and easily 
pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and 
strike with it till the feeling of resentment and 
revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of con- 
tempt and compassion. 

CHAPTER II 

ONE OF THE MOST obvious and advantageous 
departures from the so-called laws of war is the 
action of scattered groups against men pressed 
together in a mass. Such action always occurs 
in wars that take on a national character. In 
such actions, instead of two crowds opposing 
each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run 
away when attacked by stronger forces, but 
again attack when opportunity offers. This was 
done by the guerrillas in Spain, by the moun- 
tain tribes in the Caucasus, and by the Russians 
in 1812. 

People have called this kind of war "guer- 
rilla warfare" and assume that by so calling it 
they have explained its meaning. But such a 
war does not fit in under any rule and is di- 
rectly opposed to a well-known rule of tactics 
which is accepted as infallible. That rule says 
that an attacker should concentrate his forces 
in order to be stronger than his opponent at 
the moment of conflict. 

Guerrilla war (always successful, as history 
shows) directly infringes that rule. 

This contradiction arises from the fact that 
military science assumes the strength of an 
army to be identical with its numbers. Mili- 
tary science says that the more troops the 
greater the strength. Les gros bataillons ont 
tou jours raison. 1 

For military science to say this is like defin- 
ing momentum in mechanics by reference to 
the mass only: stating that momenta are equal 
or unequal to each other simply because the 
masses involved are equal or unequal. 

Momentum (quantity of motion) is the 
product of mass and velocity. 

In military affairs the strength of an army is 
the product of its mass and some unknown x. 

Military science, seeing in history innumer- 
able instances of the fact that the size of any 

1 Large battalions are always victorious. 



590 



army does not coincide with its strength and 
that small detachments defeat larger ones, ob- 
scurely admits the existence of this unknown 
factor and tries to discover itnow in a geo- 
metric formation, now in the equipment em- 
ployed, now, and most usually, in the genius 
of the commanders. But the assignment of 
these various meanings to the factor does not 
yield results which accord with the historic 
facts. 

Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false 
view (adopted to gratify the "heroes") of the 
efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by 
commanders, in order to find this unknown 
quantity. 

That unknown quantity is the spirit of the 
army, that is to say, the greater or lesser readi- 
ness to fight and face danger felt by all the 
men composing an army, quite independently 
of whether they are, or are not, fighting under 
the command of a genius, in two- or three-line 
formation, with cudgels or with rifles that re- 
peat thirty times a minute. Men who want to 
fight will always put themselves in the most 
advantageous conditions for fighting. 

The spirit of an army is the factor which 
multiplied by the mass gives the resulting 
force. To define and express the significance of 
this unknown factor the spirit of an army- 
is a problem for science. 

This problem is only solvable if we cease 
arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x 
itself the conditions under which that force 
becomes apparent such as the commands of 
the general, the equipment employed, and so 
on mistaking these for the real significance of 
the factor, and if we recognize this unknown 
quantity in its entirety as being the greater or 
lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only 
then, expressing known historic facts by equa- 
tions and comparing the relative significance 
of this factor, can we hope to define the un- 
known. 

Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting 
fifteen men, battalions, or divisions, conquer- 
that is, kill or take captive all the others, 
while themselves losing four, so that on the 
one side four and on the other fifteen were 
lost. Consequently the four were equal to the 
fifteen, and therefore 4x=i5)j. Consequently 
x/y=i$/4. This equation does not give us the 
value of the unknown factor but gives us a 
ratio between two unknowns. And by bring- 
ing variously selected historic units (battles, 
campaigns, periods of war) into such equa- 
tions, a series of numbers could be obtained in 



WAR AND PEACE 

which certain laws should exist and might be 
discovered. 

The tactical rule that an army should act in 
masses when attacking, and in smaller groups 
in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth 
that the strength of an army depends on its 
spirit. To lead men forward under fire more 
discipline (obtainable only by movement in 
masses) is needed than is needed to resist at- 
tacks. But this rule which leaves out of account 
the spirit of the army continually proves in- 
correct and is in particularly striking contrast 
to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the 
spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national 
wars. 

The French, retreating in 1812 though ac- 
cording to tactics they should have separated 
into detachments to defend themselves con- 
gregated into a mass because the spirit of the 
army had so fallen that only the mass held the 
army together. The Russians, on the contrary, 
ought according to tactics to have attacked in 
mass, but in fact they split up into small units, 
because their spirit had so risen that separate 
individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the 
French without needing any compulsion to in- 
duce them to expose themselves to hardships 
and dangers. 



CHAPTER III 

THE SO-CALLED PARTISAN WAR began with the 
entry of the French into Smolensk. 

Before partisan warfare had been officially 
recognized by the government, thousands of 
enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had 
been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peas- 
ants, who killed them off as instinctively as dogs 
worry a stray .mad dog to death. Denis Davy- 
dov, with his Russian instinct, was the first to 
recognize the value of this terrible cudgel 
which regardless of the rules of military sci- 
ence destroyed the French, and to him belongs 
the credit for taking the first step toward regu- 
larizing this method of warfare. 

On August 24 Davydov's first partisan de- 
tachment was formed and then others were 
recognized. The further the campaign pro- 
gressed the more numerous these detachments 
became. 

The irregulars destroyed the great army 
piecemeal. They gathered the fallen leaves that 
dropped of themselves from that withered tree 
the French army and sometimes shook that 
tree itself. By October, when the French were 
fleeing toward Smolensk, there were hundreds 
of such companies, of various sizes and char- 



BOOK FOURTEEN 

icters. There were some that adopted all the 
irmy methods and had infantry, artillery, 
rtaffs, and the comforts of life. Others con- 
sisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were 
also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and 
groups of peasants and landowners that re- 
mained unknown. A sacristan commanded one 
party which captured several hundred prison- 
ers in the course of a month; and there was 
Vasilfsa, the wife of a village elder, who slew 
hundreds of the French. 

The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely 
In the latter daysof October. Its first period had 
passed: when the partisans themselves, amazed 
at their own boldness, feared every minute to 
be surrounded and captured by the French, 
and hid in the forests without unsaddling, 
hardly daring to dismount and always expect- 
ing to be pursued. By the end of October this 
kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it 
had become clear to all what could be ventured 
against the French and what could not. Now 
only the commanders of detachments with 
staffs, and moving according to rules at a dis- 
tance from the French, still regarded many 
things as impossible. The small bands that had 
started their activities long before and had al- 
ready observed the French closely considered 
things possible which the commanders of the 
big detachments did not dare to contemplate. 
The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among 
the French now considered everything possible. 

On October 22, Denisov (who was one of 
the irregulars) was with his group at the height 
of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morn- 
ing he and his party had been on the move. 
All day long he had been watching from the 
forest that skirted the highroad a large French 
convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prison- 
ers separated from the rest of the army, which 
as was learned from spies and prisoners was 
moving under a strong escort to Smolensk. Be- 
sides Denisov and D61okhov (who also led a 
small party and moved in Denisov's vicinity), 
the commanders of some large divisions with 
staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Denfsov 
expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for 
it. Two of the commanders of large parties- 
one a Pole and the other a German sent in- 
vitations to Denisov almost simultaneously, re- 
questing him to join up with their divisions 
to attack the convoy. 

"No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches my- 
self," said Denisov on reading these docu- 
ments, and he wrote to the German that, de- 
spite his heartfelt desire to serve under so val- 



591 

iant and renowned a general, he had to forgo 
that pleasure because he was already under the 
command of the Polish general. To the Polish 
general he replied to the same effect, inform- 
ing him that he was already under the com- 
mand of the German. 

Having arranged matters thus, Denfsov and 
D61okhov intended, without reporting mat- 
ters to the higher command, to attack and 
seize that convoy with their own small forces. 
On October 22 it was moving from the village 
of Mikiilino to that of Shamshevo. To the left 
of the road between Mikulino and Shdmshevo 
there were large forests, extending in some 
places up to the road itself though in others a 
mile or more back from it. Through these 
forests Denfsov and his party rode all day, 
sometimes keeping well back in them and 
sometimes coming to the very edge, but never 
losing sight of the moving French. That morn- 
ing, Cossacks of Denisov's party had seized 
and carried off into the forest two wagons 
loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck 
in the mud not far from Mikulino where the 
forest ran close to the road. Since then, and 
until evening, the party had watched the move- 
ments of the French without attacking. It was 
necessary to let the French reach Shdmshevo 
quietly without alarming them and then, after 
joining Dolokhov who was to come that eve- 
ning to a consultation at a watchman's hut in 
the forest less than a mile from Shamshevo, to 
surprise the French at dawn, falling like an 
avalanche on their heads from two sides, and 
rout and capture them all at one blow. 

In their rear, more than a mile from Miku- 
lino where the forest came right up to the 
road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any 
fresh columns of French should show them- 
selves. 

Beyond Shdmshevo, D61okhov was to observe 
the road in the same way, to find out at what 
distance there were other French troops. They 
reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred 
men. Denfsov had two hundred, and D61okhov 
might have as many more, but the disparity 
of numbers did not deter Denisov. All that he 
now wanted to know was what troops these 
were and to learn that he had to capture a 
"tongue" that is, a man from the enemy col- 
umn. That morning's attack on the wagons 
had been made so hastily that the Frenchmen 
with the wagons had all been killed; only a 
little drummer boy had been taken alive, and 
as he was a straggler he could tell them noth- 
ing definite about the troops in that column. 



59* 



WAR AND PEACE 



Denisov considered it dangerous to make a 
second attack for fear of putting the whole 
column on the alert, so he sent Tikhon Shcher- 
baty, a peasant of his party, to Shdmshevo to 
try and seize at least one of the French quarter- 
masters who had been sent on in advance. 

CHAPTER IV 

IT WAS a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and 
the horizon were both the color of muddy 
water. At times a sort of mist descended, and 
then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down. 

Denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap 
from which the rain ran down was riding a 
thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. 
Like his horse, which turned its head and laid 
its ears back, he shrank from the driving rain 
and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face 
with its short, thick black beard looked angry. 

Beside Denisov rode an esaul, 1 Denfsov's 
fellow worker, also in felt cloak and sheepskin 
cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse. 

Esaul Lovdyski the Third was a tall man as 
straight as an arrow, pale-faced, fair-haired, 
with narrow light eyes and with calm self-satis- 
faction in his face and bearing. Though it was 
impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the 
horse and rider lay, yet at first glance at the 
esaul and Denfsov one saw that the latter 
was wet and uncomfortable and was a man 
mounted on a horse, while looking at the esaul 
one saw that he was as comfortable and as 
much at ease as always and that he was not a 
man who had mounted a horse, but a man who 
was one with his horse, a being consequently 
possessed of twofold strength. 

A little ahead of them walked a peasant 
guide, wet to the skin and wearing a gray 
peasant coat and a white knitted cap. 

A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirg- 
hiz mount with an enormous tail and mane 
and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in 
a blue French overcoat. 

Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a 
tattered French uniform and blue cap behind 
him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held 
on to the hussar with cold, red hands, and rais- 
ing his eyebrows gazed about him with sur- 
prise. This was the French drummer boy cap- 
tured that morning. 

Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cut- 
up forest road came hussars in threes and fours, 
and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some 
in French greatcoats, and some with horse- 
cloths over their heads. The horses, being 

1 A captain of Cossacks. 



drenched by the rain, all looked black whether 
chestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, 
close-clinging manes, looked strangely thin. 
Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, 
were all wet, slippery, and sodden, like the 
ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the 
road. The men sat huddled up trying not to 
stir, so as to warm the water that had trickled 
to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold 
water that was leaking in under their seats, 
their knees, and at the back of their necks. In 
the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two 
wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled 
Cossack horses that had been hitched on in 
front, rumbled over the tree stumps and 
branches and splashed through the water that 
lay in the ruts. 

Denisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a 
pool in the track and bumped his rider's knee 
against a tree. 

"Oh, the devil!" exclaimed Denisov angrily, 
and showing his teeth he struck his horse three 
times with his whip, splashing himself and his 
comrades with mud. 

Denisov was out of sorts both because of the 
rain and also from hunger (none of them had 
eaten anything since morning), and yet more 
because he still had no news from D61okhov 
and the man sent to capture a "tongue" had 
not returned. 

"There'll hardly be another such chance to 
fall on a transport as today. It's too risky to at- 
tack them by oneself, and if we put it off till an- 
other day one of the big guerrilla detachments 
will snatch the prey from under our noses," 
thought Denisov, continually peering forward, 
hoping to see a messenger from D61okhov. 

On coming to a path in the forest along 
which he could see far to the right, Denisov 
stopped. 

"There's someone coming," said he. 

The esaul looked in the direction Denfsov 
indicated. 

"There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But 
it is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant 
colonel himself," said the esaul, who was fond 
of using words the Cossacks did not know. 

The approaching riders having descended 
a decline were no longer visible, but they re- 
appeared a few minutes later. In front, at a 
weary gallop and using his leather whip, rode 
an officer, disheveled and drenched, whose 
trousers had worked up to above his knees. Be- 
hind him, standing in the stirrups, trotted a 
Cossack. The officer, a very young lad with a 
broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped 



BOOK FOURTEEN 

up to Denisov and handed him a sodden en- 



593 



velope. 

"From the general," said the officer. "Please 
excuse its not being quite dry." 

Denfsov, frowning, took the envelope and 
opened it. 

"There, they kept telling us: 'It's dangerous, 
it's dangerous,' " said the officer, addressing 
the esaul while Denfsov was reading the dis- 
patch. "But Komar6v and I" he pointed to 
the Cossack "were prepared. We have each 

of us two pistols But what's this?" he asked, 

noticing the French drummer boy. "A pris- 
oner? You've already been in action? May I 
speak to him?" 

"Wost6v! Ptya!" exclaimed Denisov, hav- 
ing run through the dispatch. "Why didn't you 
say who you were?" and turning with a smile 
he held out his hand to the lad. 

The officer was Pe" tya Rost6v. 

All the way Ptya had been preparing him- 
self to behave with Denisov as befitted a grown- 
up man and an officer without hinting at 
their previous acquaintance. But as soon as 
Denfsov smiled at him Petya brightened up, 
blushed with pleasure, forgot the official man- 
ner he had been rehearsing, and began telling 
him how he had already been in a battle near 
Vydzma and how a certain hussar had distin- 
guished himself there. 

"Well, I am glad to see you," Denisov inter- 
rupted him, and his face again assumed its 
anxious expression. 

"Michael Feoklftych," said he to the esaul, 
"this is again fwom that German, you know. 
He" he indicated Pdtya "is serving under 
him." 

And Denisov told the esaul that the dis- 
patch just delivered was a repetition of the Ger- 
man general's demand that he should join 
forces with him for an attack on the transport. 

"If we don't take it tomowwow, he'll snatch 
it fwom under our noses," he added. 

While Denisov was talking to the esaul, 
Pdtya abashed by Denisov's cold tone and 
supposing that it was due to the condition of 
his trousers furtively tried to pull them down 
under his greatcoat so that no one should no- 
tice it, while maintaining as martial an air as 
possible. 

"Will there be any orders, your honor?" he 
asked Denfsov, holding his hand at the salute 
and resuming the game of adjutant and gen- 
eral for which he had prepared himself, "or 
shall I remain with your honor?" 

"Orders?" Denfsov repeated thoughtfully. 



But can you stay till tomowwow?" 
"Oh, please . . . May I stay with you?" cried 



"But, just what did the genewal tell you? 
To weturn at once?" asked Denfsov. 

P&lt;kya blushed. 

"He gave me no instructions. I think I 
could?" he returned, inquiringly. 

"Well, all wight," said Denfsov. 

And turning to his men he directed a party 
to go on to the halting place arranged near the 
watchman's hut in the forest, and told the 
officer on the Kirghiz horse (who performed 
the duties of an adjutant) to go and find out 
where D61okhov was and whether he would 
come that evening. Denisov himself intended 
going with the esaul and P(hya to the edge of 
the forest where it reached out to Shamshevo, 
to have a look at the part of the French biv- 
ouac they were to attack next day. 

"Well, old fellow," said he to the peasant 
guide, "lead us to Shamshevo." 

Denisov, PeHya, and the esaul, accompanied 
by some Cossacks and the hussar who had the 
prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the 
edge of the forest. 

CHAPTER V 

THE RAIN HAD STOPPED, and only the mist was 
falling and drops from the trees. Denisov, the 
esaul, and Pckya rode silently, following the 
peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping 
lightly with outturned toes and moving noise- 
lessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet 
leaves, silently led them to the edge of the 
forest. 

He ascended an incline, stopped, looked 
about him, and advanced to where the screen 
of trees was less dense. On reaching a large 
oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves, he 
stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them 
with his hand. 

Denisov and Pckya rode up to him. From the 
spot where the peasant was standing they could 
see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, 
on a downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. 
To the right, beyond a steep ravine, was a 
small village and a landowner's house with a 
broken roof. In the village, in the house, in the 
garden, by the well, by the pond, over all the 
rising ground, and all along the road uphill 
from the bridge leading to the village, not 
more than five hundred yards away, crowds of 
men could be seen through the shimmering 
mist. Their un-Russian shouting at their horses 
which were straining uphill with the carts, and 



594 

their calls to one another, could be clearly 

heard. 

"Bwing the prisoner here," said Denfsov in 
a low voice, not taking his eyes off the French. 

A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, 
and took him to Denfsov. Pointing to the 
French troops, Denisov asked him what these 
and those of them were. The boy, thrusting his 
cold hands into his pockets and lifting his eye- 
brows, looked at Denisov in affright, but in 
spite of an evident desire to say all he knew 
gave confused answers, merely assenting to 
everything Denfsov asked him. Denfsov turned 
away from him frowning and addressed the 
esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him. 

P&lt;kya, rapidly turning his head, looked now 
at the drummer boy, now at Denisov, now at 
the esaul, and now at the French in the village 
and along the road, trying not to miss any- 
thing of importance. 

"Whether Dolokhov comes or not, we must 
seize it, eh?" said Denfsov with a merry sparkle 
in his eyes. 

"It is a very suitable spot," said the esaul. 

"We'll send the iniantwy down by the 
swamps," Denisov continued. "They'll cweep 
up to the garden; you'll wide up fwom there 
with the Cossacks" he pointed to a spot in the 
forest beyond the village "and I with my hus- 
sars fwom here. And at the signal shot . . ." 

"The hollow is impassable there's a swamp 
there," said the esaul. "The horses would sink. 
We must ride round more to the left. . . ." 

While they were talking in undertones the 
crack of a shot sounded from the low ground 
by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, 
then another, and the sound of hundreds of 
seemingly merry French voices shouting to- 
gether came up from the slope. For a moment 
Denfsov and the esaul drew back. They were 
so near that they thought they were the cause 
of the firing and shouting. But the firing and 
shouting did not relate to them. Down below, 
a man wearing something red was running 
through the marsh. The French were evidently 
firing and shouting at him. 

"Why, that's our Tfkhon," said the esaul. 

"So it is! It is!" 

"The wascall" said Denfsov. 

"He'll get away!" said the esaul, screwing up 
his eyes. 

The man whom they called Tfkhon, having 
run to the stream, plunged in so that the water 
splashed in the air, and, having disappeared 
for an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all 
black with the wet, and ran on. The French 



WAR AND PEACE 

who had been pursuing him stopped. 

"Smart, that!" said the esaul. 

"What a beast!" said Denfsov with his 
former look of vexation. "What has he been 
doing all this time?" 

"Who is he?" asked P&lt;hya. 

"He's our plastun. 1 1 sent him to capture a 
'tongue.' " 

"Oh, yes," said P^tya, nodding at the first 
words Denfsov uttered as if he understood it 
all, though he really did not understand any- 
thing of it. 

Tfkhon Shcherbdty was one of the most in- 
dispensable men in their band. He was a peas- 
ant from Pokr6vsk, near theriver Gzhat. When 
Denfsov had come to Pokr6vsk at the begin- 
ning of his operations and had as usual sum- 
moned the village elder and asked him what 
he knew about the French, the elder, as though 
shielding himself, had replied, as all village 
elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard 
anything of them. But when Denfsov explained 
that his purpose was to kill the French, and 
asked if no French had strayed that way, the 
elder replied that some "more-orderers" had 
really been at their village, but that Tfkhon 
Shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with 
such matters. Denfsov had Tfkhon called and, 
having praised him for his activity, said a few 
words in the elder's presence about loyalty to 
the Tsar and the country and the hatred of 
the French that all sons of the fatherland 
should cherish. 

"We don't do the French any harm," said 
Tfkhon, evidently frightened by Denfsov's 
words. "We only fooled about with the lads 
for fun, you know! We killed a score or so of 
'more-orderers,' but we did no harm else. . . ." 

Next day when Denfsov had left Pokr6vsk, 
having quite forgotten about this peasant, it 
was reported to him that Tfkhon had attached 
himself to their party and asked to be allowed 
to remain with it. Denfsov gave orders to let 
him do so. 

Tfkhon, who at first did rough work, laying 
campfires, fetching water, flaying dead horses, 
and so on, soon showed a great liking and 
aptitude for partisan warfare. At night he 
would go out for booty and always brought 
back French clothing and weapons, and when 
told to would bring in French captives also. 
Denfsov then relieved him from drudgery and 
began taking him with him when he went out 
on expeditions and had him enrolled among 
the Cossacks. 

1 An unmounted sharpshooter. TR. 



BOOK FOURTEEN

Tfkhon did not like riding, and always went 
on foot, never lagging behind the cavalry. He 
was armed with a musketoon (which he car- 
ried rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which 
latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth, with equal 
ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching 
thick bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy would 
split logs with blows at arm's length, or hold- 
ing the head of the ax would cut thin little 
pegs or carve spoons. In Denfsov's party he 
held a peculiar and exceptional position. When 
anything particularly difficult or nasty had to 
be done to push a cart out of the mud with 
one's shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by 
its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or 
walk more than thirty miles in a day every- 
body pointed laughingly at Tikhon. 

"It won't hurt that devil he's as strong as a 
horse!" they said of him. 

Once a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to 
capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the 
fleshy part of the back. That wound (which 
Tfkhon treated only with internal and exter- 
nal applications of vodka) was the subject of 
the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment- 
jokes in which Tfkhon readily joined. 

"Hallo, matel Never again? Gave you a 
twist?" the Cossacks would banter him. And 
Tfkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, 
pretended to be angry and swore at the French 
with the funniest curses. The only effect of this 
incident on Tfkhon was that after being 
wounded he seldom brought in prisoners. 

He was the bravest and most useful man in 
the party. No one found more opportunities 
for attacking, no one captured or killed more 
Frenchmen, and consequently he was made the 
buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and 
willingly accepted that role. Now he had been 
sent by Denfsov overnight to Shamshevo to 
capture a "tongue." But whether because he 
had not been content to take only one French- 
man or because he had slept through the night, 
he had crept by day into some bushes right 
among the French and, as Denfsov had wit- 
nessed from above, had been detected by them. 

CHAPTER VI 

AFTER TALKING for some time with the esaul 
about next day's attack, which now, seeing 
how near they were to the French, he seemed 
to have definitely decided on, Denfsov turned 
his horse and rode back. 

"Now, my lad, we'll go and get dwy," he said 
to P6tya. 

As they approached the watchhouse Denfsov 



stopped, peering into the forest. Among the 
trees a man with long legs and long, swinging 
arms, wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and 
a Kazan hat, was approaching with long, light 
steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder 
and an ax stuck in his girdle. When he espied 
Denfsov he hastily threw something into the 
bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy 
brim, and approached his commander. It was 
Tfkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked face 
and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied 
merriment. He lifted his head high and gazed 
at Denfsov as if repressing a laugh. 

"Well, where did you disappear to?" in- 
quired Denfsov. 

"Where did I disappear to? I went to get 
Frenchmen," answered Tikhon boldly and 
hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass 
voice. 

"Why did you push yourself in there by day- 
light? You ass! Well, why haven't you taken 
one?" 

"Oh, I took one all right," said Tfkhon. 
"Where is he?" 

"You see, I took him first thing at dawn," 
Tfkhon continued, spreading out his flat feet 
with outturned toes in their bast shoes. "I took 
him into the forest. Then I see he's no good 
and think I'll go and fetch a likelier one." 

"You see? . . . What a wogue it's just as I 
thought," said Denisov to the esaul. "Why 
didn't you bwing that one?" 

"What was the good of bringing him?" 
Tfkhon interrupted hastily and angrily "that 
one wouldn't have done for you. As if I don't 
know what sort you want!" 

"What a bwute you are! . . . Well?" 
"I went for another one," Tfkhon con- 
tinued, "and I creptlike this through the wood 
and lay down." (He suddenly lay down on his 
stomach with a supple movement to show how 
he had done it.) "One turned up and I grabbed 
him, like this." (He jumped up quickly and 
lightly.) " 'Come along to the colonel/ I said. 
He starts yelling, and suddenly there were 
four of them. They rushed at me with their 
little swords. So I went for them with my ax, 
this way: 'What are you up to?' says I. 'Christ 
be with you!' " shouted Tfkhon, waving his 
arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his 
chest. 

"Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to 
your heels through the puddles!" said the 
esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes. 

Ptya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed 
that they all refrained from laughing. He 



596 



WAR AND PEACE 



turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to 
the esaul's and Denfsov's, unable to make out 
what it all meant. 

"Don't play the fool!" said Denfsov, cough- 
ing angrily. "Why didn't you bwing the first 
one?" 

Tikhon scratched his back with one hand 
and his head with the other, then suddenly his 
whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish 
grin, disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth 
(that was why he was called Shcherbaty the 
gap-toothed). Denfsov smiled, and Ptya burst 
into a peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon 
himself joined. 

"Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing," 
said Tfkhon. "The clothes on him poor stuff! 
How could I bring him? And so rude, your 
honor! Why, he says: 'I'm a general's son my- 
self, I won't go!' he says." 

"You are a bwute!" said Denisov. "I wanted 
to question . . ." 

"But I questioned him," said Tikhon. "He 
said he didn't know much. 'There are a lot of 
us,' he says, 'but all poor stuff only soldiers in 
name,' he says. 'Shout loud at them,' he says, 
'and you'll take them all,' " Tikhon concluded, 
looking cheerfully and resolutely into Deni- 
sov's eyes. 

"I'll give you ahundwedsharp lashes that'll 
teach you to play the fool!" said Denisov 
severely. 

"But why are you angry?" remonstrated 
Tfkhon, "just as if I'd never seen your French- 
men! Only wait till it gets dark and I'll fetch 
you any of them you want three if you like." 

"Well, let's go," said Denisov, and rode all 
the way to the watchhouse in silence and 
frowning angrily. 

Tikhon followed behind and P^tya heard 
the Cossacks laughing with him and at him, 
about some pair of boots he had thrown into 
the bushes. 

When the fit of laughter that had seized him 
at Tfkhon's words and smile had passed and 
Ptya realized for a moment that this Tfkhon 
had killed a man, he felt uneasy. He looked 
round at the captive drummer boy and felt a 
pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted 
only a moment. He felt it necessary to hold his 
head higher, to brace himself, and to ques- 
tion the esaul with an air of importance about 
tomorrow's undertaking, that he might not be 
unworthy of the company in which he found 
himself. 

The officer who had been sent to inquire 
met Denfsov on the way with the news that 



D61okhov was soon coming and that all was 
well with him. 

Denfsovat once cheered upand, calling Ptya 
to him, said: "Well, tell me about yourself." 

CHAPTER VII 

PTYA, HAVING LEFT his people after their de- 
parture from Moscow, joined his regiment and 
was soon taken as orderly by a general com- 
manding a large guerrilla detachment. From 
the time he received his commission, and espe- 
cially since he had joined the active army and 
taken part in the battle of Vyazma, Pe*tya had 
been in a constant state of blissful excitement 
at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic 
hurry not to miss any chance to do something 
really heroic. He was highly delighted with 
what he saw and experienced in the army, but 
at the same time it always seemed to him that 
the really heroic exploits were being per- 
formed just where he did not happen to be. 
And he was always in a hurry to get where he 
was not. 

When on the twenty-first of October his gen- 
eral expressed a wish to send somebody to 
Denisov's detachment, P^tya begged so pite- 
ously to be sent that the general could not re- 
fuse. But when dispatching him he recalled 
P^tya's mad action at the battle of VyAzma, 
where instead of riding by the road to the place 
to which he had been sent, he had galloped to 
the advanced line under the fire of the French 
and had there twice fired his pistol. So now 
the general explicitly forbade his taking part 
in any action whatever of Denfsov's. That was 
why Pchya had blushed and grown confused 
when Denfsov asked him whether he could 
stay. Before they had ridden to the outskirts 
of the forest P^tya had considered that he must 
carry out his instructions strictly and return at 
once. But when he saw the French and saw 
Tikhon and learned that there would certainly 
be an attack that night, he decided, with the 
rapidity with which young people change their 
views, that the general, whom he had greatly 
respected till then, was a rubbishy German, 
that Denfsov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and 
Tfkhon a hero too, and that it would be shame- 
ful for him to leave them at a moment of dif- 
ficulty. 

It was already growing dusk when Denfsov, 
Ptya, and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse. 
In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, 
and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up 
rough shelters in the glade and were kindling 
glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where 



BOOK FOURTEEN 



597 



the French could not see the smoke. In the 
passage of the small watchhouse a Cossack with 
sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. 
In the room three officers of Denisov's band 
were converting a door into a tabletop. Ptya 
took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, 
and at once began helping the officers to fix up 
the dinner table. 

In ten minutes the table was ready and a 
napkin spread on it. On the table were vodka, 
a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and 
salt. 

Sitting at table with the officers and tearing 
the fat savory mutton with his hands, down 
which the grease trickled, Ptya was in an 
ecstatic childish state of love for all men, and 
consequently of confidence that others loved 
him in the same way. 

"So then what do you think, Vasfli Dmf- 
trich?" said he to Denfsov. "It's all right my 
staying a day with you?" And not waiting for 
a reply he answered his own question: "You 
see I was told to find out well, I am finding 
out. . . . Only do let me into the very . . . into 
the chief ... I don't want a reward. . . . But I 
want . . ." 

Ptya clenched his teeth and looked around, 
throwing back his head and flourishing his 
arms. 

"Into the vewy chief . . ." Denisov repeated 
with a smile. 

"Only, please let me command something, 
so that I may really command . . ." Ptya went 
on. "What would it be to you? . . . Oh, you 
want a knife?" he said, turning to an officer 
who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton. 

And he handed him his clasp knife. The 
officer admired it. 

"Please keep it. I have several like it," said 
Ptya, blushing. "Heavens! I was quite for- 
getting!" he suddenly cried. "I have some rai- 
sins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We 
have a new sutler and he has such capital 
things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to 
something sweet. Would you like some? . . ." 
and Ptya ran out into the passage to his Cos- 
sack and brought back some bags which con- 
tained about five pounds of raisins. "Have 
some, gentlemen, have some!" 

"You want a coffeepot, don't you?" he asked 
the esaul "I bought a capital one from our 
sutler! He has splendid things. And he's very 
honest, that's the chief thing. I'll be sure to 
send it to you. Or perhaps your flints are giv- 
ing out, or are worn out that happens some- 
times, you know. I have brought some with 



me, here they are" and he showed a bag "a 
hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. 
Please take as many as you want, or all if you 
like " 

Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said 
too much, Ptya stopped and blushed. 

He tried to remember whether he had not 
done anything else that was foolish. And run- 
ning over the events of the day he remembered 
the French drummer boy. "It's capital for us 
here, but what of him? Where have they put 
him? Have they fed him? Haven't they hurt 
his feelings?" he thought. But having caught 
himself saying too much about the flints, he 
was now afraid to speak out. 

"I might ask," he thought, "but they'll say: 
'He's a boy himself and so he pities the boy.' 
I'll show them tomorrow whether I'm a boy. 
Will it seem odd if I ask?" Ptya thought. 
"Well, never mind!" and immediately, blush- 
ing and looking anxiously at the officers to see 
if they appeared ironical, he said: 

"May I call in that boy who was taken pris- 
oner and give him something to eat? . . . Per- 
haps . . ." 

"Yes, he's a poor little fellow," said Denisov, 
who evidently saw nothing shameful in this 
reminder. "Call him in. His name is Vincent 
Bosse. Have him fetched." 

"I'll call him," said Pekya. 

"Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow," 
' Denisov repeated. 

Ptya was standing at the door when Denisov 
said this. He slipped in between the officers, 
came close to Denisov, and said: 

"Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how 
fine, how splendid!" 

And having kissed Denfsov he ran out of the 
hut. 

"Bosse! Vincent!" Ptya cried, stopping out- 
side the door. 

"Who do you want, sir?" asked a voice in 
the darkness. 

Ptya replied that he wanted the French lad 
who had been captured that day. 

"Ah, Ves^nny?" said a Cossack. 

Vincent, the boy's name, had already been 
changed by the Cossacks into Vestnny (vernal) 
and into Vestnya by the peasants and soldiers. 
In both these adaptations the reference to 
spring (vesnd) matched the impression made 
by the young lad. 

"He is warming himself there by the bon- 
fire. Ho, Vesnyal Vesnyal Ves^nny!" laugh- 
ing voices were heard calling to one another 
in the darkness* 



598 



WAR AND PEACE 



"He's a smart lad," said an hussar standing 
near Ptya. "We gave him something to eat 
a while ago. He was awfully hungry!" 

The sound of bare feet splashing through 
the mud was heard in the darkness, and the 
drummer boy came to the door. 

"Ah, c'est vous!" said P&lt;hya. "Voulez-vous 
manger* N'ayez pas peur, on ne vous {era pas 
de mat," J he added shyly and affectionately, 
touching the boy's hand. "Entrez, entrez." a 

"Merci, monsieur'' 3 said the drummer boy 
in a trembling almost childish voice, and he 
began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold. 

There were many things Petya wanted to 
say to the drummer boy, but did not dare to. 
He stood irresolutely beside him in the pas- 
sage. Then in the darkness he took the boy's 
hand and pressed it. 

"Come in, come in!" he repeated in a gentle 
whisper. "Oh, what can I do for him?" he 
thought, and opening the door he let the boy 
pass in first. 

When the boy had entered the hut, Pdtya 
sat down at a distance from him, considering 
it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. 
But he fingered the money in his pocket and 
wondered whether it would seem ridiculous 
to give some to the drummer boy.

THE ARRIVAL OF D6LOKHOV diverted P^tya's at- 
tention from the drummer boy, to whom Denf- 
sov had had some mutton and vodka given, 
and whom he had had dressed in a Russian 
coat so that he might be kept with their band 
and not sent away with the other prisoners. 
Pe"tya had heard in the army many stories of 
D61okhov's extraordinary bravery and of his 
cruelty to the French, so from the moment he 
entered the hut Pe*tya did not take his eyes 
from him, but braced himself up more and 
more and held his head high, that he might 
not be unworthy even of such company. 

D61okhov's appearance amazed Ptya by its 
simplicity. 

Denisov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, 
had an icon of Nicholas the Wonder- Worker 
on his breast, and his way of speaking and 
everything he did indicated his unusual posi- 
tion. But Dolokhov, who in Moscow had worn 
a Persian costume, had now the appearance of 
a most correct officer of the Guards. He was 

1 "Ah, it's you! Do you want something to eat? 
Don't be afraid, they won't hurt you." 
* "Come in, come in." 
8 "Thank you, sir." 



clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman's padded 
coat with an Order of St. George at his button- 
hole and a plain forage cap set straight on his 
head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner 
of the room, and without greeting anyone went 
up to Denfsov and began questioning him 
about the matter in hand. Denisov told him of 
the designs the large detachments had on the 
transport, of the message Ptya had brought, 
and his own replies to both generals. Then he 
told him all he knew of the French detach- 
ment. 

"That's so. But we must know what troops 
they are and their numbers," said D61okhov. 
"It will be necessary to go there. We can't start 
the affair without knowing for certain how 
many of them there are. I like to work accu- 
rately. Here now wouldn't one of these gen- 
tlemen like to ride over to the French camp 
with me? I have brought a spare uniform." 

"I, I ... I'll go with you!" cried Pckya. 

"There's no need for you to go at all," said 
Denisov, addressing D61okhov, "and as for 
him, I won't let him go on any account." 

"I like that!" exclaimed P^tya. "Why 
shouldn't I go?" 

"Because it's useless." 

"Well, you must excuse me, because . . . be- 
cause ... I shall go, and that's all. You'll take 
me, won't you?" he said, turning to Dolokhov. 

"Why not?" D61okhov answered absently, 
scrutinizing the face of the French drummer 
boy. "Have you had that youngster with you 
long?" he asked Denisov. 

"He was taken today but he knows nothing. 
I'm keeping him with me." 

"Yes, and where do you put the others?" 
inquired Dolokhov. 

"Where? I send them away and take a we- 
ceipt for them," shouted Denisov, suddenly 
flushing. "And I say boldly that I have not a 
single man's life on my conscience. Would it 
be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hun- 
dwed men to town under escort, instead of 
staining I speak bluntly staining the honor 
of a soldier?" 

"That kind of amiable talk would be suit- 
able from this young count of sixteen," said 
D61okhov with cold irony, "but it's time for 
you to drop it." 

"Why, I've not said anything! I only say 
that I'll certainly go with you," said Ptya 
shyly. 

"But for you and me, old fellow, it's time to 
drop these amenities," continued D61okhov, 
as if he found particular pleasure in speaking 



BOOK FOURTEEN 

of this subject which irritated Denfsov. "Now, 
why have you kept this lad?" he went on, sway- 
ing his head. "Because you are sorry for him! 
Don't we know those 'receipts' of yours? You 
send a hundred men away, and thirty get there. 
The rest either starve or get killed. So isn't it 
all the same not to send them?" 

The esaul, screwing up his light-colored 
eyes, nodded approvingly. 

"That's not the point. I'm not going to dis- 
cuss the matter. I do not wish to take it on my 
conscience. You say they'll die. All wight. Only 
not by my fault!" 

D61okhov began laughing. 

"Who has told them not to capture me these 
twenty times over? But if they did catch me 
they'd string me up to an aspen tree, and you 
with all your chivalry just the same." He 
paused. "However, we must get to work. Tell 
the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French 
uniforms in it. Well, are you coming with me?" 
he asked P&lt;kya. 

"I? Yes, yes, certainly!" cried Ptya, blush- 
ing almost to tears and glancing at Denfsov. 

While D61okhov had been disputing with 
Denfsov what should be done with prisoners, 
Ptftya had once more felt awkward and restless; 
but again he had no time to grasp fully what 
they were talking about. "If grown-up, dis- 
tinguished men think so, it must be necessary 
and right," thought he. "But above all Denfsov 
must not dare to imagine that I'll obey him and 
that he can order me about. I will certainly go 
to the French camp with D61okhov. If he can, 
so can I!" 

And to all Denisov's persuasions, Pchya re- 
plied that he too was accustomed to do every- 
thing accurately and not just anyhow, and that 
he never considered personal danger. 

"For you'll admit that if we don't know for 
sure how many of them there are . . . hundreds 
of lives may depend on it, while there are only 
two of us. Besides, I want to go very much and 
certainly will go, so don't hinder me," said he. 
"It will only make things worse. . . ."

CHAPTER IX 

HAVING PUT ON French greatcoats and shakos, 
Ptya and D61okhov rode to the clearing from 
which Denfsov had reconnoitered the French 
camp, and emerging from the forest in pitch 
darkness they descended into the hollow. On 
reaching the bottom, D61okhov told the Cos- 
sacks accompanying him to await him there 
and rode on at a quick trot along the road to 
the bridge. P^tya, his heart in his mouth with 



excitement, rode by his side. 

"If we're caught, I won't be taken alive! I 
have a pistol," whispered he. 

"Don't talk Russian," said D61okhov in a 
hurried whisper, and at that very moment they 
heard through the darkness the challenge: "Qui 
viveV 1 and the click of a musket. 

The blood rushed to Pchya's face and he 
grasped his pistol. 

"Landers du 6-me," 2 replied D61okhov, 
neither hastening nor slackening his horse's 
pace. 

The black figure of a sentinel stood on the 
bridge. 

"M ot d'ordre." * 

Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced 
at a walk. 

"Dites done, le colonel Gerard eat ici?" * he 
asked. 

"Mot d'ordre'' repeated the sentinel, bar- 
ring the way and not replying. 

"Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinel- 
les ne demandent pas le mot d'ordre . . ." cried 
Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding 
straight at the sentinel. "Je vous demande si 
le colonel est ici." 5 

And without waiting for an answer from 
the sentinel, who had stepped aside, D61okhov 
rode up the incline at a walk. 

Noticing the black outline of a man crossing 
the road, D61okhov stopped him and inquired 
where the commander and officers were. The 
man, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, 
stopped, came close up to Dolokhov's horse, 
touched it with his hand, and explained sim- 
ply and in a friendly way that the commander 
and the officers were higher up the hill to the 
right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called 
the landowner's house. 

Having ridden up the road, on both sides 
of which French talk could be heard around 
the campfires, D61okhov turned into the court- 
yard of the landowner's house. Having ridden 
in, he dismounted and approached a big blaz- 
ing campfire, around which sat several men 
talking noisily. Something was boiling in a 
small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a 
soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit 
up by the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring 
its contents with a ramrod. 

"Who goes there?" 

"Lancers of the 6th Regiment." 

"Password." 

"Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?" 

"When an officer is making his round, sentinels 
don't ask him for the password. ... I am asking 
you if the colonel is here." 



6oo 



WAR AND PEACE 



"Oh, he's a hard nut to crack," said one of 
the officers who was sitting in the shadow at 
the other side of the fire. 

"He'll make them get a move on, those fel- 
lows!" said another, laughing. 

Both fell silent, peering out through the 
darkness at the sound of D61okhov's and 
P^tya's steps as they advanced to the fire lead- 
ing their horses. 

"Bonjour, messieurs!" J said Dolokhov loud- 
ly and clearly. 

There was a stir among the officers in the 
shadow beyond the fire, and one tall, long- 
necked officer, walking round the fire, came 
up to D61okhov. 

"Is that you, Cldment?" he asked. "Where 
the devil . . . ?" But, noticing his mistake, he 
broke off short and, with a frown, greeted 
Dolokhov as a stranger, asking what he could 
do for him. 

Dolokhov said that he and his companion 
were trying to overtake their regiment, and 
addressing the company in general asked 
whether they knew anything of the 6th Regi- 
ment. None of them knew any thing, and Ptya 
thought the officers were beginning to look at 
him and D61okhov with hostility and suspi- 
cion. For some seconds all were silent. 

"If you were counting on the evening soup, 
you have come too late," said a voice from be- 
hind the fire with a repressed laugh. 

Dolokhov replied that they were not hungry 
and must push on farther that night. 

He handed the horses over to the soldier 
who was stirring the pot and squatted down 
on his heels by the fire beside the officer with 
the long neck. That officer did not take his 
eyes from D61okhov and again asked to what 
regiment he belonged. D61okhov, as if he had 
not heard the question, did not reply, but 
lighting a short French pipe which he took 
from his pocket began asking the officer in 
how far the road before them was safe from 
Cossacks. 

"Those brigands are everywhere," replied 
an officer from behind the fire. 

D61okhov remarked that the Cossacks were 
a danger only to stragglers such as his compan- 
ion and himself, "but probably they would not 
dare to attack large detachments?" he added 
inquiringly. No one replied. 

"Well, now he'll come away," P^tya thought 
every moment as he stood by the campfire lis- 
tening to the talk. 

But D61okhov restarted the conversation 

*"Good day, gentlemen!" 



which had dropped and began putting direct 
questions as to how many men there were in 
the battalion, how many battalions, and how 
many prisoners. Asking about the Russian 
prisoners with that detachment, D61okhov 
said: 

"A horrid business dragging these corpses 
about with one! It would be better to shoot 
such rabble," and burst into loud laughter, so 
strange that Ptya thought the French would 
immediately detect their disguise, and invol- 
untarily took a step back from the campfire. 

No one replied a word to D61okhov's laugh- 
ter, and a French officer whom they could not 
see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and 
whispered something to a companion. D61ok- 
hov got up and called to the soldier who was 
holding their horses. 

"Will they bringour horses or not?" thought 
P^tya, instinctively drawing nearer to D61ok- 
hov. 

The horses were brought. 

"Good evening, gentlemen," said D61okhov. 

Pdtya wished to say "Good night" but could 
not utter a word. The officers were whispering 
together. D61okhov was a long time mounting 
his horse which would not stand still, then he 
rode out of the yard at a footpace. Ptya rode 
beside him, longing to look round to see 
whether or no the French were running after 
them, but not daring to. 

Coming out onto the road D61okhov did 
not ride back across the open country, but 
through the village. At one spot he stopped 
and listened. "Do you hear?" he asked. Ptya 
recognized the sound of Russian voices and 
saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round 
their campfires. When they had descended to 
the bridge Ptya and D61okhov rode past the 
sentinel, who without saying a word paced mo- 
rosely up and down it, then they descended 
into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited 
them. 

"Well now, good-by. Tell Denfsov, 'at the 
first shot at daybreak,' " said D61okhov and 
was about to ride away, but Pchya seized hold 
of him. 

"Really!" he cried, "you are such a hero! 
Oh, how fine, how splendid! How I love 
you!" 

"All right, all right!" said D61okhov. But 
Ptya did not let go of him and D61okhov saw 
through the gloom that Ptya was bending to- 
ward him and wanted to kiss him. D61okhov 
kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and van- 
ished into the darkness.

CHAPTER X 

HAVING RETURNED to the watchman's hut, 
Ptya found Denisov in the passage. He was 
awaiting Pehya's return in a state of agitation, 
anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him 

go- 

"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Yes, thank 
God!" he repeated, listening to Pe*tya's raptur- 
ous account. "But, devil take you, I haven't 
slept because of you! Well, thank God. Now 
lie down. We can still get a nap before morn- 
ing." 

"But . . . no," said Ptya, "I don't want to 
sleep yet. Besides I know myself, if I fall asleep 
it's finished. And then I am used to not sleep- 
ing before a battle." 

He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling 
the details of his expedition and vividly pic- 
turing to himself what would happen next 
day. 

Then, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he 
rose and went out of doors. 

It was still quite dark outside. The rain was 
over, but drops were still falling from the trees. 
Near the watchman's hut the black shapes of 
the Cossacks' shanties and of horses tethered to- 
gether could be seen. Behind the hut the dark 
shapes of the two wagons with their horses be- 
side them were discernible, and in the hollow 
the dying campfire gleamed red. Not all the 
Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and 
there, amid the sounds of falling drops and 
the munching of the horses near by, could be 
heard low voices which seemed to be whisper- 
ing. 

Ptya came out, peered into the darkness, 
and went up to the wagons. Someone was snor- 
ing under them, and around them stood sad- 
dled horses munching their oats. In the dark 
Ptya recognized his own horse, which he called 
"Karabdkh" * though it was of Ukranian breed, 
and went up to it. 

"Well, Karabdkh! We'll do some service to- 
morrow," said he, sniffing its nostrils and kiss- 
ing it. 

"Why aren't you asleep, sir?" said a Cossack 
who was sitting under a wagon. 

"No, ah . . . Likhachev isn't that your name? 
Do you know I have only just come back! 
We've been into the French camp." 

And Pdtya gave the Cossack a detailed ac- 
count not only of his ride but also of his object, 
and why he considered it better to risk his life 
than to act "just anyhow." 

1 Karabakh is a district in the sou them Caucasus, 
famous for its breed of horses. TR. 



"Well, you should get some sleep now," said 
the Cossack. 

"No, I am used to this," said Ptya. "I say, 
aren't the flints in your pistols worn out? I 
brought some with me. Don't you want any? 
You can have some." 

The Cossack bent forward from under the 
wagon to get a closer look at Pdtya. 

"Because I am accustomed to doing every- 
thing accurately," said Ptya. "Some fellows 
do things just anyhow, without preparation, 
and then they're sorry for it afterwards. I don't 
like that." 

"Just so," said the Cossack. 

"Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear 
fellow, will you sharpen my saber for me? It's 
got bl . . ." (Pckya feared to tell a lie, and the 
saber never had been sharpened.) "Can you do 
it?" 

"Of course I can." 

Likhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, 
and soon Pdtya heard the warlike sound of 
steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon 
and sat on its edge. The Cossack was sharpen- 
ing the saber under the wagon. 

"I say! Are the lads asleep?" asked Ptya. 

"Some are, and some aren'tlike us." 

"Well, and that boy?" 

"Vese*nny? Oh, he's thrown himself down 
there in the passage. Fast asleep after his 
fright. He was that glad!" 

After that Ptya remained silent for a long 
time, listening to the sounds. He heard foot- 
steps in the darkness and a black figure ap- 
peared. 

"What are you sharpening?" asked a man 
coming up to the wagon. 

"Why, this gentleman's saber." 

"That's right," said the man, whom Ptya 
took to be an hussar. "Was the cup left here?" 

"There, by the wheel!" 

The hussar took the cup. 

"It must be daylight soon," said he, yawn- 
ing, and went away. 

Ptya ought to have known that he was in 
a forest with Denfsov's guerrilla band, less 
than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon 
captured from the French beside which horses 
were tethered, that under it Likhachev was sit- 
ting sharpening a saber for him, that the big 
dark blotch to the right was the watchman's 
hut, and the red blotch below to the left was 
the dying embers of a campfire, that the man 
who had come for the cup was an hussar who 
wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor 
wanted to know anything of all this. He was 



602 



WAR AND PEACE 



in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled 
reality. The big dark blotch might really be 
the watchman's hut or it might be a cavern 
leading to the very depths of the earth. Per- 
haps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the 
eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was 
really sitting on a wagon, but it might very 
well be that he was not sitting on a wagon 
but on a terribly high tower from which, if 
he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day 
or a whole month, or go on falling and never 
reach the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cos- 
sack, Likhachev, who was sitting under the 
wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest, 
most wonderful, most splendid man in the 
world, whom no one knew of. It might really 
have been that an hussar came for water and 
went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had 
simply vanisheddisappeared altogether and 
dissolved into nothingness. 

Nothing Ptya could have seen now would 
have surprised him. He was in a fairy kingdom 
where everything was possible. 

He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a 
fairy realm like the earth. It was clearing, and 
over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly 
sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it 
looked as if the clouds were passing, and a 
clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed 
as if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes 
the sky seemed to be rising high, high over- 
head, and then it seemed to sink so low that 
one could touch it with one's hand. 

P^tya's eyes began to close and he swayed a 
little. 

The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was 
heard. The horses neighed and jostled one 
another. Someone snored. 

"Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg . . ." hissed the 
saber against the whetstone, and suddenly 
Ptya heard an harmonious orchestra playing 
some unknown, sweetly solemn hymn. Ptya 
was as musical as Natdsha and more so than 
Nicholas, but had never learned music or 
thought about it, and so the melody that un- 
expectedly came to his mind seemed to him 
particularly fresh and attractive. The music 
became more and more audible. The melody 
grew and passed from one instrument to an- 
other. And what was played was a fugue 
though Ptya had not the least conception of 
what a fugue is. Each instrument now re- 
sembling a violin and now a horn, but better 
and clearer than violin or horn played its 
own part, and before it had finished the mel- 
ody merged with another instrument that be- 



gan almost the same air, and then with a third 
and a fourth; and they all blended into one 
and again became separate and again blended, 
now into solemn church music, now into some- 
thing dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant. 

"Oh why, that was in a dream!" Ptya said 
to himself, as he lurched forward. "It's in my 
ears. But perhaps it's music of my own. Well, 
go on, my music! Now! . . ." 

He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if 
from a distance, sounds fluttered, grew into 
harmonies, separated, blended, and again all 
mingled into the same sweet and solemn 
hymn. "Oh, this is delightful! As much as I 
like and as I like!" said Ptya to himself. He 
tried to conduct that enormous orchestra. 

"Now softly, softly die away!" and the 
sounds obeyed him. "Now fuller, more joyful. 
Still more and more joyful!" And from an un- 
known depth rose increasingly triumphant 
sounds. "Now voices join in!" ordered Ptya. 
And at first from afar he heard men's voices 
and then women's. The voices grew in har- 
monious triumphant strength, and P^tya lis- 
tened to their surpassing beauty in awe and 
joy. 

With a solemn triumphal march there min- 
gled a song, the drip from the trees, and the 
hissing of the saber, "Ozheg-zheg-zheg . . ." 
and again the horses jostled one another and 
neighed, not disturbing the choir but joining 
in it. 

Ptya did not know how long this lasted: he 
enjoyed himself all the time, wondered at his 
enjoyment and regretted that there was no 
one to share it. He was awakened by Lik- 
hache'v's kindly voice. 

"It's ready, your honor; you can split a 
Frenchman in half with it!" 

Ptya woke up. 

"It's getting light, it's really getting light!" 
he exclaimed. 

The horses that had previously been in- 
visible could now be seen to their very tails, 
and a watery light showed itself through the 
bare branches. Ptya shook himself, jumped 
up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it 
to Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, 
tested it, and sheathed it. The Cossacks were 
untying their horses and tightening their sad- 
dle girths. 

"And here's the commander," said Likha- 
che*v. 

Denisov came out of the watchman's hut 
and, having called P^tya, gave orders to get 
ready. 



BOOK FOURTEEN 



603 



CHAPTER XI 

THE MEN rapidly picked out their horses in 
the semidarkness, tightened their saddle girths, 
and formed companies. Denisov stood by the 
watchman's hut giving final orders. The in- 
fantry of the detachment passed along the 
road and quickly disappeared amid the trees 
in the mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet 
splashing through the mud. The esaul gave 
some orders to his men. Pe"tya held his horse 
by the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order 
to mount. His face, having been bathed in 
cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were 
particularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down 
his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmi- 
cally. 

"Well, is ev'wything weady?" asked Denisov. 
"Bwing the horses." 

The horses were brought. Denisov was 
angry with the Cossack because the saddle 
girths were too slack, reproved him, and 
mounted. Ptya put his foot in the stirrup. His 
horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but 
Ptya leaped quickly into the saddle uncon- 
scious of his own weight and, turning to look 
at the hussars starting in the darkness behind 
him, rode up to Denisov. 

"Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some com- 
mission! Please . . . for God's sake ... 1" said 
he. 

Denisov seemed to have forgotten Pe"tya's 
very existence. He turned to glance at him. 

"I ask one thing of you," he said sternly, "to 
obey me and not shove you'self fo'ward any- 
where." 

He did not say another word to P^tya but 
rode in silence all the way. When they had 
come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably 
growing light over the field. Denisov talked in 
whispers with the esaul and the Cossacks rode 
past P&lt;kya and Denisov. When they had all 
ridden by, Denisov touched his horse and rode 
down the hill. Slipping onto their haunches 
and sliding, the horses descended with their 
riders into the ravine. Ptya rode beside Denf- 
sov, the pulsation of his body constantly in- 
creasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, 
but the mist still hid distant objects. Having 
reached the valley, Denisov looked back and 
nodded to a Cossack beside him. 

"The signall" said he. 

The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang 
out. In an instant the tramp of horses gallop- 
ing forward was heard, shouts came from vari- 
ous sides, and then more shots. 

At the first sound of trampling hoofs and 



shouting, Ptya lashed his horse and loosening 
his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denisov 
who shouted at him. It seemed to Ptya that at 
the moment the shot was fired it suddenly be- 
came as bright as noon. He galloped to the 
bridge. Cossacks were galloping along the road 
in front of him. On the bridge he collided with 
a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he gal- 
loped on. In front of him soldiers, probably 
Frenchmen, were running from right to left 
across the road. One of them fell in the mud 
under his horse's feet. 

Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy 
with something. From the midst of that crowd 
terrible screams arose. Pchya galloped up, and 
the first thing he saw was the pale face and 
trembling jaw of a Frenchman, clutching the 
handle of a lance that had been aimed at him. 

"Hurrah! . . . Lads! . . . ours!" shouted Ptya, 
and giving rein to his excited horse he gal- 
loped forward along the village street. 

He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cos- 
sacks, hussars, and ragged Russian prisoners, 
who had come running from both sides of the 
road, were shouting something loudly and in- 
coherently. A gallant-looking Frenchman, in 
a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning 
red face, had been defending himself against 
the hussars. When Ptya galloped up the 
Frenchman had already fallen. "Too late 
again!" flashed through Pdtya's mind and he 
galloped on to the place from which the rapid 
firing could be heard. The shots came from 
the yard of the landowner's house he had 
visited the night before with Dolokhov. The 
French were making a stand there behind a 
wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown 
with bushes and were firing at the Cossacks 
who crowded at the gateway. Through the 
smoke, as he approached the gate, Pchya saw 
Dolokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish 
tint, shouting to his men. "Go round! Wait 
for the infantry!" he exclaimed as Pe*tya rode 
up to him. 

"Wait? . . . Hurrah-ah-ah!" shouted Ptya, 
and without pausing a moment galloped to 
the place whence came the sounds of firing 
and where the smoke was thickest. 

A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled 
past, while others plashed against something. 
The Cossacks and D61okhov galloped after 
Ptya into the gateway of the courtyard. In the 
dense wavering smoke some of the French 
threw down their arms and ran out of the 
bushes to meet the Cossacks, while others ran 
down the hill toward the pond. Ptya was

galloping along the courtyard, but instead of 
holding the reins he waved both his arms 
about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther 
and farther to one side in his saddle. His 
horse, having galloped up to a campfire that 
was smoldering in the morning light, stopped 
suddenly, and Ptya fell heavily on to the 
wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms 
and legs jerked rapidly though his head was 
quite motionless. A bullet had pierced his 
skull. 

After speaking to the senior French officer, 
who came out of the house with a white 
handkerchief tied to his sword and announced 
that they surrendered, D61okhov dismounted 
and went up to Ptya, who lay motionless with 
outstretched arms. 

"Done for!" he said with a frown, and went 
to the gate to meet Denfsov who was riding 
toward him. 

"Killed?" cried Denisov, recognizing from 
a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude- 
very familiar to him in which P^tya's body 
was lying. 

"Done forl" repeated Dolokhov as if the 
utterance of these words afforded him pleas- 
ure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, 
who were surrounded by Cossacks who had 
hurried up. "We won't take them!" he called 
out to Denisov. 

Denisov did not reply; he rode up to Ptya, 
dismounted, and with trembling hands turned 
toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespat- 
tered face which had already gone white. 

"I am used to something sweet. Raisins, 
fine ones . . . take them all!" he recalled Pdtya's 
words. And the Cossacks looked round in sur- 
prise at the sound, like the yelp of a dog, with 
which Denfsov turned away, walked to the 
wattle fence, and seized hold of it. 

Among the Russian prisoners rescued by 
Denfsov and Dolokhov was Pierre Bezukhov. 

CHAPTER XII 

DURING THE WHOLE of their march from Mos- 
cow no fresh orders had been issued by the 
French authorities concerning the party of 
prisoners among whom was Pierre. On the 
twenty-second of October that party was no 
longer with the same troops and baggage trains 
with which it had left Moscow. Half the 
wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled 
the first stages with them had been captured 
by Cossacks, the other half had gone on ahead. 
Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who 
had marched in front of the prisoners was 



left; they had all disappeared. The artillery 
the prisoners had seen in front of them during 
the first days was now replaced by Marshal 
Junot's enormous baggage train, convoyed by 
Westphalians, Behind the prisoners came a 
cavalry baggage train. 

From Vyazma onwards the French army, 
which had till then moved in three columns, 
went on as a single group. The symptoms of 
disorder that Pierre had noticed at their first 
halting place after leaving Moscow had now 
reached the utmost limit. 

The road along which they moved was 
bordered on both sides by dead horses; ragged 
men who had fallen behind from various regi- 
ments continually changed about, now join- 
ing the moving column, now again lagging 
behind it. 

Several times during the march false alarms 
had been given and the soldiers of the escort 
had raised their muskets, fired, and run head- 
long, crushing one another, but had after- 
wards reassembled and abused each other for 
their causeless panic. 

These three groups traveling together the 
cavalry stores, the convoy of prisoners, and 
Junot's baggage train still constituted a sep- 
arate and united whole, though each of the 
groups was rapidly melting away. 

Of the artillery baggage train which had 
consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons, 
not more than sixty now remained; the rest 
had been captured or left behind. Some of 
Junot's wagons also had been captured or 
abandoned. Three wagons had been raided 
and robbed by stragglers from Davout's corps. 
From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned 
that a larger guard had been allotted to that 
baggage train than to the prisoners, and that 
one of their comrades, a German soldier, had 
been shot by the marshal's own order because 
a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had 
been found in his possession. 

The group of prisoners had melted away 
most of all. Of the three hundred and thirty 
men who had set out from Moscow fewer than 
a hundred now remained. The prisoners were 
more burdensome to the escort than even the 
cavalry saddles or Junot's baggage. They under- 
stood that the saddles and Junot's spoon might 
be of some use, but that cold and hungry 
soldiers should have to stand and guard equally 
cold and hungry Russians who froze and 
lagged behind on the road (in which case the 
order was to shoot them) was not merely in- 
comprehensible but revolting. And the escort, 



BOOK FOURTEEN 



605 



as if afraid, in the grievous condition they 
themselves were in, of giving way to the pity 
they felt for the prisoners and so rendering 
their own plight still worse, treated them with 
particular moroseness and severity. 

At Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the 
convoy, after locking the prisoners in a stable, 
had gone off to pillage their own stores, several 
of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the 
wall and ran away, but were recaptured by 
the French and shot. 

The arrangement adopted when they start- 
ed, that the officer prisoners should be kept 
separate from the rest, had long since been 
abandoned. All who could walk went together, 
and after the third stage Pierre had rejoined 
Karatdev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog 
that had chosen Karataev for its master. 

On the third day after leaving Moscow 
Karatdev again fell ill with the fever he had 
suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as 
he grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away 
from him. Pierre did not know why, but since 
Karataev had begun to grow weaker it had 
cost him an effort to go near him. When he 
did so and heard the subdued moaning with 
which Karataev generally lay down at the 
halting places, and when he smelled the odor 
emanating from him which was now stronger 
than before, Pierre moved farther away and 
did not think about him. 

While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had 
learned not with his intellect but with his 
whole being, by life itself, that man is created 
for happiness, that happiness is within him, in 
the satisfaction of simple human needs, and 
that all unhappiness arises not from privation 
but from superfluity. And now during these 
last three weeks of the march he had learned 
still another new, consolatory truththat noth- 
ing in this world is terrible. He had learned 
that as there is no condition in which man 
can be happy and entirely free, so there is no 
condition in which he need be unhappy and 
lack freedom. He learned that suffering and 
freedom have their limits and that those limits 
are very near together; that the person in a 
bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered 
as keenly as he now, sleeping on the bare damp 
earth with one side growing chilled while the 
other was warming; and that when he had put 
on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as 
he did now when he walked with bare feet 
that were covered with sores his footgear hav- 
ing long since fallen to pieces. He discovered 
that when he had married his wife of his own 



free will as it had seemed to himhe had been 
no more free than now when they locked him 
up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself 
subsequently termed his sufferings, but which 
at the time he scarcely felt, the worst was the 
state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. 
(The horseflesh was appetizing and nourish- 
ing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they 
used instead of salt was even pleasant; there 
was no great cold, it was always warm walking 
in the daytime, and at night there were the 
campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed 
his body.) The one thing that was at first hard 
to bear was his feet. 

After the second day's march Pierre, having 
examined his feet by the campfire, thought it 
would be impossible to walk on them; but 
when everybody got up he went along, limp- 
ing, and, when he had warmed up, walked 
without feeling the pain, though at night his 
feet were more terrible to look at than before. 
However, he did not look at them now, but 
thought of other things. 

Only now did Pierre realize the full strength 
of life in man and the saving power he has 
of transferring his attention from one thing 
to another, which is like the safety valve 
of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to 
blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain 
limit. 

He did not see and did not hear how they 
shot the prisoners who lagged behind, though 
more than a hundred perished in that way. He 
did not think of Karataev who grew weaker 
every day and evidently would soon have to 
share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about 
himself. The harder his position became and 
the more terrible the future, the more inde- 
pendent of that position in which he found 
himself were the joyful and comforting 
thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came 
to him. 

CHAPTER XIII 

AT MIDDAY on the twenty-second of October 
Pierre was going uphill along the muddy, slip- 
pery road, looking at his feet and at the rough- 
ness of the way. Occasionally he glanced at the 
familiar crowd around him and then again at 
his feet. The former and the latter were alike 
familiar and his own. The blue-gray bandy- 
legged dog ran merrily along the side of the 
road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self- 
satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping 
along on three, and then again going on all 
four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat 



6o6 



WAR AND PEACE 



on the carrion. The dog was merrier and sleek- 
er than it had been in Moscow. All around lay 
the flesh of different animals from men to 
horses in various stages of decomposition; 
and as the wolves were kept off by the passing 
men the dog could eat all it wanted. 

It had been raining since morning and had 
seemed as if at any moment it might cease and 
the sky clear, but after a short break it began 
raining harder than before. The saturated road 
no longer absorbed the water, which ran along 
the ruts in streams. 

Pierre walked along, looking from side to 
side, counting his steps in threes, and reckon- 
ing them off on his fingers. Mentally address- 
ing the rain, he repeated: "Now then, now 
then, go on! Pelt harder!" 

It seemed to him that he was thinking of 
nothing, but far down and deep within him 
his soul was occupied with something impor- 
tant and comforting. This something was a 
most subtle spiritual deduction from a con- 
versation with Karataev the day before. 

At their yesterday's halting place, feeling 
chilly by a dying campfire, Pierre had got up 
and gone to the next one, which was burning 
better. There Platon Karataev was sitting cov- 
ered up head and all with his greatcoat as if 
it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his 
effective and pleasant though now feeble voice 
a story Pierre knew. It was already past mid- 
night, the hour when Karataev was usually free 
of his fever and particularly lively. When 
Pierre reached the fire and heard Platon 's 
voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic 
face brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a pain- 
ful prick at his heart. His feeling of pity for 
this man frightened him and he wished to go 
away, but there was no other fire, and Pierre 
sat down, trying not to look at Plat6n. 

"Well, how are you?" he asked. 

"How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God 
won't grant us death," replied Plat6n, and at 
once resumed the story he had begun. 

"And so, brother," he continued, with a 
smile on his pale emaciated face and a particu- 
larly happy light in his eyes, " you see, broth- 
er . . ." 

Pierre had long been familiar with that 
story. Karataev had told it to him alone some 
half-dozen times and always with a specially 
joyful emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre 
now listened to that tale as to something new, 
and the quiet rapture Karataev evidently felt 
as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre. 
The story was of an old merchant who lived a 



good and God-fearing life with his family, and 
who went once to the Nizhni fair with a com- 
paniona rich merchant. 

Having put up at an inn they both went to 
sleep, and next morning his companion was 
found robbed and with his throat cut. A blood- 
stained knife was found under the old mer- 
chant's pillow. He was tried, knouted, and his 
nostrils having been torn off, "all in due 
form" as Karataev put it, he was sent to hard 
labor in Siberia. 

"And so, brother" (it was at this point that 
Pierre came up), "ten years or more passed by. 
The old man was living as a convict, submit- 
ting as he should and doing no wrong. Only 
he prayed to God for death. Well, one night 
the convicts were gathered just as we are, with 
the old man among them. And they began tell- 
ing what each was suffering for, and how they 
had sinned against God. One told how he had 
taken a life, another had taken two, a third 
had set a house on fire, while another had 
simply been a vagrant and had done nothing. 
So they asked the old man: 'What are you be- 
ing punished for, Daddy?' 'I, my dear broth- 
ers,' said he, 'am being punished for my own 
and other men's sins. But I have not killed 
anyone or taken anything that was not mine, 
but have only helped my poorer brothers. I 
was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had 
much property.' And he went on to tell them 
all about it in due order. 'I don't grieve for 
myself,' he says, 'God, it seems, has chastened 
me. Only I am sorry for rny old wife and the 
children,' and the old man began to weep. 
Now it happened that in the group was the 
very man who had killed the other merchant. 
'Where did it happen, Daddy?' he said. 'When, 
and in what month?' He asked all about it and 
his heart began to ache. So he comes up to the 
old man like this, and falls down at his feet! 
'You are perishing because of me, Daddy,' he 
says. 'It's quite true, lads, that this man,' he 
says, 'is being tortured innocently and for 
nothing! I,' he says, 'did that deed, and I put 
the knife under your head while you were 
asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,' he says, 'for Christ's 
sake!' " 

Karataev paused, smiling joyously as he 
gazed into the fire, and he drew the logs to- 
gether. 

"And the old man said, 'God will forgive 
you, we are all sinners in His sight. I suffer 
for my own sins,' and he wept bitter tears. 
Well, and what do you think, dear friends?" 
Karatdev continued, his face brightening more 



BOOK FOURTEEN 



607 



and more with a rapturous smile as if what he 
now had to tell contained the chief charm and 
the whole meaning of his story: "What do you 
think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed 
to the authorities. 'I have taken six lives/ he 
says (he was a great sinner), 'but what I am 
most sorry for is this old man. Don't let him 
suffer because of me.' So he confessed and it 
was all written down and the papers sent off in 
due form. The place was a long way off, and 
while they were judging, what with one thing 
and another, filling in the papers all in due 
formthe authorities I meantime passed. 
The affair reached the Tsar. After a while the 
Tsar's decree came: to set the merchant free 
and give him a compensation that had been 
awarded. The paper arrived and they began 
to look for the old man. 'Where is the old man 
who has been suffering innocently and in 
vain? A paper has come from the Tsar!' so 
they began looking for him/' here Karatdev's 
lower jaw trembled, "but God had already 
forgiven him he was dead! That's how it was, 
dear fellows!" Karataev concluded and sat for 
a long time silent, gazing before him with a 
smile. 

And Pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully 
filled not by the story itself but by its mysteri- 
ous significance: by the rapturous joy that lit 
up Karataev's face as he told it, and the mystic 
significance of that joy. 

CHAPTER XIV 

"A vos places!'' * suddenly cried a voice. 

A pleasant feeling of excitement and an ex- 
pectation of something joyful and solemn was 
aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and 
the prisoners. From all sides came shouts of 
command, and from the left came smartly 
dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing 
the prisoners at a trot. The expression on all 
faces showed the tension people feel at the 
approach of those in authority. The prisoners 
thronged together and were pushed off the 
road. The convoy formed up. 

"The Emperor! The Emperor! The Mar- 
shall The Dukel" and hardly had the sleek 
cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by 
six gray horses rattled by. Pierre caught a 
glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with 
a tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white 
face. It was one of the marshals. His eye fell on 
Pierre's large and striking figure, and in the 
expression with which he frowned and looked 

l "To your places!" 



away Pierre thought he detected sympathy and 
a desire to conceal that sympathy. 

The general in charge of the stores galloped 
after the carriage with a red and frightened 
face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several 
officers formed a group and some soldiers 
crowded round them. Their faces all looked 
excited and worried. 

"What did he say? What did he say?" Pierre 
heard them ask. 

While the marshal was passing, the prison- 
ers had huddled together in a crowd, and 
Pierre saw Karatdev whom he had not yet seen 
that morning. He sat in his short overcoat 
leaning against a birch tree. On his face, be- 
sides the look of joyful emotion it had worn 
yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant 
who suffered innocently, there was now an ex- 
pression of quiet solemnity. 

Karataev looked at Pierre with his kindly 
round eyes now filled with tears, evidently 
wishing him to come near that he might say 
something to him. But Pierre was not suffi- 
ciently sure of himself. He made as if he did not 
notice that look and moved hastily away. 

When the prisoners again went forward 
Pierre looked round. Karatdev was still sitting 
at the side of the road under the birch tree and 
two Frenchmen were talking over his head. 
Pierre did not look round again but went 
limping up the hill. 

From behind, where Karatdev had been sit- 
ting, came the sound of a shot. Pierre heard 
it plainly, but at that moment he remembered 
that he had not yet finished reckoning up how 
many stages still remained to Smolensk a cal- 
culation he had begun before the marshal 
went by. And he again started reckoning. Two 
French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom 
carried a lowered and smoking gun. They 
both looked pale, and in the expression on 
their faces one of them glanced timidly at 
Pierre there was something resembling what 
he had seen on the face of the young soldier 
at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier 
and remembered that, two days before, that 
man had burned his shirt while drying it at 
the fire and how they had laughed at him. 

Behind him, where Karataev had been sit- 
ting, the dog began to howl. "What a stupid 
beast! Why is it howling?" thought Pierre. 

His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking 
beside him, avoided looking back at the place 
where the shot had been fired and the dog was 
howling, just as Pierre did, but there w-is a 
set look on all their faces. 



6o8 



WAR AND PEACE 



CHAPTER XV 



THE STORES, the prisoners, and the marshal's 
baggage train stopped at the village of Sham- 
shevo. The men crowded together round the 
campfires. Pierre went up to the fire, ate some 
roast horseflesh, lay down with his back to the 
fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again 
slept as he had done at Mozhdysk after the 
battle of Borodin6. 

Again real events mingled with dreams and 
again someone, he or another, gave expression 
to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts 
that had been expressed in his dream at 
Mozhdysk. 

"Life is everything. Life is God. Everything 
changes and moves and that movement is God. 
And while there is life there is joy in con- 
sciousness of the divine. To love life is to love 
God. Harder and more blessed than all else 
is to love this life in one's sufferings, in in- 
nocent sufferings." 

"Karatdevl" came to Pierre's mind. 

And suddenly he saw vividly before him a 
long-forgotten, kindly old man who had given 
him geography lessons in Switzerland. "Wait 
a bit," said the old man, and showed Pierre a 
globe. This globe was alivea vibrating ball 
without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface 
consisted of drops closely pressed together, and 
all these drops moved and changed places, 
sometimes several of them merging into one, 
sometimes one dividing into many. Each drop 
tried to spread out and occupy as much space 
as possible, but others striving to do the same 
compressed it, sometimes destroyed it, and 
sometimes merged with it. 

"That is life," said the old teacher. 

"How simple and clear it is," thought Pierre. 
"How is it I did not know it before?" 

"God is in the midst, and each drop tries to 
expand so as to reflect Him to the greatest 
extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from 
the surface, sinks to the depths, and again 
emerges. There now, Karataev has spread out 
and disappeared. Do you understand, my 
child?" said the teacher. 

"Do you understand, damn you?" shouted 
a voice, and Pierre woke up. 

He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman 
who had just pushed a Russian soldier away 
was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting 
a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves 
were rolled up and his sinewy, hairy, red hands 
with their short fingers deftly turned the ram- 
rod. His brown morose face with frowning 



brows was clearly visible by the glow of the 
charcoal. 

"It's all the same to him," he muttered, turn- 
ing quickly to a soldier who stood behind him. 
"Brigand! Get away!" 

And twisting the ramrod he looked gloom- 
ily at Pierre, who turned away and gazed into 
the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier 
the Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting 
near the fire patting something with his hand. 
Looking more closely Pierre recognized the 
blue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wag- 
ging its tail. 

"Ah, he's come?" said Pierre. "And Plat" he 
began, but did not finish. 

Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of 
memories awoke in his fancy of the look Pla- 
t6n had given him as he sat under the tree, of 
the shot heard from that spot, of the dog's 
howl, of the guilty faces of the two Frenchmen 
as they ran past him, of the lowered and smok- 
ing gun, and of Karatdev's absence at this halt 
and he was on the point of realizing that 
Karataev had been killed, but just at that in- 
stant, he knew not why, the recollection came 
to his mind of a summer evening he had spent 
with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of 
his house in Kiev. And without linking up 
the events of the day or drawing a conclusion 
from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a 
vision of the country in summertime mingled 
with memories of bathing and of the liquid, 
vibrating globe, and he sank into water so 
that it closed over his head. 

Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts 
and loud and rapid firing. French soldiers were 
running past him. 

"The Cossacks!" one of them shouted, and 
a moment later a crowd of Russians surround- 
ed Pierre. 

For a long time he could not understand 
what was happening to him. All around he 
heard his comrades sobbing with joy. 

"Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!" old 
soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as they embraced 
Cossacks and hussars. 

The hussars and Cossacks crowded round 
the prisoners; one offered them clothes, an- 
other boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed 
as he sat among them and could not utter a 
word. He hugged the first soldier who ap- 
proached him, and kissed him, weeping. 

D61okhov stood at the gate of the ruined 
house, letting a crowd of disarmed Frenchmen 
pass by. The French, excited by all that had 
happened, were talking loudly among them- 



BOOK FOURTEEN 



609 



selves, but as they passed D61okhov who gently 
switched his boots with his whip and watched 
them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, 
they became silent. On the opposite side stood 
D61okhov's Cossack, counting the prisoners 
and marking off each hundred with a chalk 
line on the gate. 

"How many?" D61okhov asked the Cossack. 

"The second hundred," replied the Cos- 
sack. 

"Filez, filez!" * D61okhov kept saying, having 
adopted this expression from the French, and 
when his eyes met those of the prisoners they 
flashed with a cruel light. 

Denisov, bareheaded and with a gloomy 
face, walked behind some Cossacks who were 
carrying the body of Ptya Rost6v to a hole 
that had been dug in the garden. 

CHAPTER XVI 

AFTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH OF OCTOBER when 
the frosts began, the flight of the French as- 
sumed a still more tragic character, with men 
freezing, or roasting themselves to death at the 
campfires, while carriages with people dressed 
in furs continued to drive past, carrying away 
the property that had been stolen by the Em- 
peror, kings, and dukes; but the process of the 
flight and disintegration of the French army 
went on essentially as before. 

From Moscow to Vyizma the French army 
of seventy-three thousand men not reckoning 
the Guards (who did nothing during the 
whole war but pillage) was reduced to thirty- 
six thousand, though not more than five thou- 
sand had fallen in battle. From this beginning 
the succeeding terms of the progression could 
be determined mathematically. The French 
army melted away and perished at the same 
rate from Moscow to Vyazma, from Vyazma to 
Smolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina, and 
from the Berezina to Vilna independently of 
the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the 
pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other 
particular conditions. Beyond Vyazma the 
French army instead of moving in three col- 
umns huddled together into one mass, and so 
went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his Em- 
peror (we know how far commanding officers 
allow themselves to diverge from the truth in 
describing the condition of an army) and this 
is what he said: 

I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the 
condition of the various corps I have had occasion 

1 "Get along, get along!" 



to observe during different stages of the last two 
or three days' march. They are almost disbanded. 
Scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the 
standards of their regiments, the others go off by 
themselves in different directions hoping to find 
food and escape discipline. In general they regard 
Smolensk as the place where they hope to recover. 
During the last few days many of the men have 
been seen to throw away their cartridges and their 
arms. In such a state of affairs, whatever your ulti- 
mate plans may be, the interest of Your Majesty's 
service demands that the army should be rallied at 
Smolensk and should first of all be freed from in- 
effectives, such as dismounted cavalry, unnecessary 
baggage, and artillery material that is no longer 
in proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, 
who are worn out with hunger and fatigue, need 
supplies as well as a few days' rest. Many have died 
these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This 
state of things is continually becoming worse and 
makes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is 
applied the troops will no longer be under control 
in case of an engagement. 
November 9: twenty miles from Smolensk. 

After staggering into Smolensk which 
seemed to them a promised land, the French, 
searching for food, killed one another, sacked 
their own stores, and when everything had 
been plundered fled farther. 

They all went without knowing whither or 
why they were going. Still less did that genius, 
Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any 
orders to him. But still he and those about 
him retained their old habits: wrote com- 
mands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; 
called one another sire, mon cousin, prince 
d'Eckrniihl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these 
orders and reports were only on paper, noth- 
ing in them was acted upon for they could not 
be carried out, and though they entitled one 
another Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, 
they all felt that they were miserable wretches 
who had done much evil for which they had 
now to pay. And though they pretended to be 
concerned about the army, each was thinking 
only of himself and of how to get away quickly 
and save himself. 

CHAPTER XVII 

THE MOVEMENTS of the Russian and French 
armies during the campaign from Moscow 
back to the Niemen were like those in a game 
of Russian blindman's bluff, in which two 
players are blindfolded and one of them oc- 
casionally rings a little bell to inform the 
catcher of his whereabouts. First he rings his 
bell fearlessly, but when he gets into a tight 



6io 



WAR AND PEACE 



place he runs away as quietly as he can, and 
often thinking to escape runs straight into his 
opponent's arms. 

At first while they were still moving along 
the Kaluga road, Napoleon's armies made 
their presence known, but later when they 
reached the Smolensk road they ran holding 
the clapper of their bell tight and of ten think- 
ing they were escaping ran right into the Rus- 
sians. 

Owing to the rapidity of the French flight 
and the Russian pursuit and the consequent 
exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of 
approximately ascertaining the enemy's posi- 
tionby cavalry scoutingwas not available. 
Besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid 
change of position by each army, even what 
information was obtained could not be de- 
livered in time. If news was received one day 
that the enemy had been in a certain position 
the day before, by the third day when some- 
thing could have been done, that army was 
already two days' march farther on and in 
quite another position. 

One army fled and the other pursued. Be- 
yond Smolensk there were several different 
roads available for the French, and one would 
have thought that during their stay of four 
days they might have learned where the enemy 
was, might have arranged some more advan- 
tageous plan and undertaken something new. 
But after a four days' halt the mob, with no 
maneuvers or plans, again began running 
along the beaten track, neither to the right 
nor to the left but along the old the worst- 
road, through Krasnoe and Orsha. 

Expecting the enemy from behind and not 
in front, the French separated in their flight 
and spread out over a distance of twenty-four 
hours. In front of them all fled the Emperor, 
then the kings, then the dukes. The Russian 
army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to 
the right beyond the Dnieper which was the 
only reasonable thing for him to do them- 
selves turned to the right and came out onto 
the highroad at Krasnoe. And here as in a 
game of blindman's buff the French ran into 
our vanguard. Seeing their enemy unexpect- 
edly the French fell into confusion and stopped 
short from the sudden fright, but then they 
resumed their flight, abandoning their com- 
rades who were farther behind. Then for three 
days separate portions of the French army-- 
first Murat's (the vice-king's), then Davout's, 
and then Ney's ran, as it were, the gauntlet of 
the Russian army. They abandoned one an- 



other, abandoned all their heavy baggage, 
their artillery, and half their men, and fled, 
getting past the Russians by night by making 
semicircles to the right. 

Ney, who came last, had been busying him- 
self blowing up the walls of Smolensk which 
were in nobody's way, because despite the un- 
fortunate plight of the French or because of 
it, they wished to punish the floor against 
which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had 
had a corps of ten thousand men, reached 
Napoleon at Orsha* with only one thousand 
men left, having abandoned all the rest and 
all his cannon, and having crossed the Dnieper 
at night by stealth at a wooded spot. 

From Orshd they fled farther along the 
road to Vilna, still playing at blindman's buff 
with the pursuing army. At the Berezina 
they again became disorganized, many were 
drowned and many surrendered, but those 
who got across the river fled farther. Their 
supreme chief donned a fur coat and, having 
seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone, 
abandoning his companions. The others who 
could do so drove away too, leaving those who 
could not to surrender or die. 

CHAPTER XVIII 

THIS CAMPAIGN consisted in a flight of the 
French during which they did all they could 
to destroy themselves. From the time they 
turned onto the Kaluga road to the day their 
leader fled from the army, none of the move- 
ments of the crowd had any sense. So one 
might have thought that regarding this period 
of the campaign the historians, who attributed 
the actions of the mass to the will of one man, 
would have found it impossible to make the 
story of the retreat fit their theory. But no! 
Mountains of books have been written by the 
historians about this campaign, and every- 
where are described Napoleon's arrangements, 
the maneuvers, and his profound plans which 
guided the army, as well as the military genius 
shown by his marshals. 

The retreat from Malo-Yaroslavets when he 
had a free road into a well-supplied district 
and the parallel road was open to him along 
which Kutiizov afterwards pursued him this 
unnecessary retreat along a devastated road- 
is explained to us as being due to profound 
considerations. Similarly profound considera- 
tions are given for his retreat from Smolensk 
to Orsha. Then his heroism at Krasnoe is de- 
scribed, where he is reported to have been 
prepared to accept battle and take personal 



BOOK FOURTEEN

command, and to have walked about with a 
birch stick and said: 

"J'ai assez fait I'empereur; il est temps de 
faire le general" * but nevertheless immedi- 
ately ran away again, abandoning to its fate 
the scattered fragments of the army he left 
behind. 

Then we are told of the greatness of soul 
of the marshals, especially of Ney a greatness 
of soul consisting in this: that he made his way 
by night around through the forest and across 
the Dnieper and escaped to Orsha, abandon- 
ing standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his 
men. 

And lastly, the final departure of the great 
Emperor from his heroic army is presented to 
us by the historians as something great and 
characteristic of genius. Even that final run- 
ning away, described in ordinary language as 
the lowest depth of baseness which every child 
is taught to be ashamed of even that act finds 
justification in the historians' language. 

When it is impossible to stretch the very 
elastic threads of historical ratiocination any 
farther, when actions are clearly contrary to 
all that humanity calls right or even just, the 
historians produce a saving conception of 
"greatness." "Greatness," it seems, excludes the 
standards of right and wrong. For the "great" 
man nothing is wrong, there is no atrocity for 
which a "great" man can be blamed. 

"C'est grand!" 2 say the historians, and 
there no longer exists either good or evil but 
only "grand" and "not grand." Grand is good, 
not grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in 
their conception, of some special animals 
called "heroes. "And Napoleon, escaping home 
in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those 
who were not merely his comrades but were 
(in his opinion) men he had brought there, 
feels que c'est grand, 9 and his soul is tran- 
quil. 

"Du sublime (he saw something sublime in 
himseff) au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas" * said 
he. And the whole world for fifty years has 
been repeating: "Sublime! Grand! Napoleon 
le Grand!" Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a 
qu'un pas. 

And it occurs to no one that to admit a 
greatness not commensurable with the stand- 
ard of right and wrong is merely to admit 

1 "I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is 
time to act the general." 

"It is great!" 

8 That it is great. 

4 "From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a 
step." 



one's own nothingness and immeasurable 
meanness. 

For us with the standard of good and evil 
given us by Christ, no human actions are in- 
commensurable. And there is no greatness 
where simplicity, goodness, and truth are ab- 
sent. 

CHAPTER XIX 

WHAT RUSSIAN, reading the account of the last 
part of the campaign of 1812, has not experi- 
enced an uncomfortable feeling of regret, dis- 
satisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not 
asked himself how it is that the French were 
not all captured or destroyed when our three 
armies surrounded them in superior numbers, 
when the disordered French, hungry and 
freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as 
the historians relate) the aim of the Russians 
was to stop the French, to cut them off, and 
capture them all? 

How was it that the Russian army, which 
when numerically weaker than the French had 
given battle at Borodin6, did not achieve its 
purpose when it had surrounded the French 
on three sides and when its aim was to cap- 
ture them? Can the French be so enormously 
superior to us that when we had surrounded 
them with superior forces we could not beat 
them? How could that happen? 

History (or what is called by that name) re- 
plying to these questions says that this oc- 
curred because Kutuzov and Tormdsov and 
Chichag6v, and this man and that man, did 
not execute such and such maneuvers. . . . 

But why did they not execute those maneu- 
vers? And why if they were guilty of not carry- 
ing out a prearranged plan were they not tried 
and punished? But even if we admitted that 
Kutuzov, Chichag6v, and others were the cause 
of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehen- 
sible why, the position of the Russian army 
being what it was at Kr&amp;moe and at the Bere- 
zina (in both cases we had superior forces), 
the French army with its marshals, kings, and 
Emperor was not captured, if that was what 
the Russians aimed at. 

The explanation of this strange fact given 
by Russian military historians (to the effect 
that Kutiizov hindered an attack) is unfound- 
ed, for we know that he could not restrain the 
troops from attacking at Vyazma and Taru- 
tino. 

Why was the Russian army which with in- 
ferior forces had withstood the enemy in full 
strength at Borodin6 defeated at Krdsnoeand 



612 



WAR AND PEACE 



the Berezina by the disorganized crowds of the 
French when it was numerically superior? 

If the aim of the Russians consisted in cut- 
ting off and capturing Napoleon and his mar- 
shalsand that aim was not merely frustrated 
but all attempts to attain it were most shame- 
fully baffledthen this last period of the cam- 
paign is quite rightly considered by the French 
to be a series of victories, and quite wrongly 
considered victorious by Russian historians. 

The Russian military historians in so far 
as they submit to claims of logic must admit 
that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical 
rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, 
must reluctantly admit that the French retreat 
from Moscow was a series of victories for Na- 
poleon and defeats for Kutuzov. 

But putting national vanity entirely aside 
one feels that such a conclusion involves a con- 
tradiction, since the series of French victories 
brought the French complete destruction, while 
the series of Russian defeats led to the total 
destruction of their enemy and the liberation 
of their country. 

The source of this contradiction lies in the 
fact that the historians studying the events 
from the letters of the sovereigns and the gen- 
erals, from memoirs, reports, projects, and so 
forth, have attributed to this last period of the 
war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely 
that of cutting off and capturing Napoleon 
with his marshals and his army. 

There never was or could have been such 
an aim, for it would have been senseless and 
its attainment quite impossible. 

It would have been senseless, first because 
Napoleon's disorganized army was flying from 
Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, 
was doing just what every Russian desired. So 
what was the use of performing various opera- 
tions on the French who were running away 
as fast as they possibly could? 

Secondly, it would have been senseless to 
block the passage of men whose whole energy 
was directed to flight. 

Thirdly, it would have been senseless to 
sacrifice one's own troops in order to destroy 
the French army, which without external in- 
terference was destroying itself at such a rate 
that, though its path was not blocked, it could 
not carry across the frontier more than it 
actually did in December, namely a hundredth 
part of the original army. 

Fourthly, it would have been senseless to 
wish to take captive the Emperor, kings, and 
dukes whose capture would have been in- the 



highest degree embarrassing for the Russians, 
as the most adroit diplomatists of the time 
(Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. 
Still more senseless would have been the wish 
to capture army corps of the French, when our 
own army had melted away to half before 
reaching Krdsnoe and a whole division would 
have been needed to convoy the corps of 
prisoners, and when our men were not always 
getting full rations and the prisoners already 
taken were perishing of hunger. 

All the profound plans about cutting off 
and capturing Napoleon and his army were 
like the plan of a market gardener who, when 
driving out of his garden a cow that had 
trampled down the beds he had planted, 
should run to the gate and hit the cow on the 
head. The only thing to be said in excuse of 
that gardener would be that he was very 
angry. But not even that could be said for 
those who drew up this project, for it was not 
they who had suffered from the trampled beds. 

But besides the fact that cutting off Na- 
poleon with his army would have been sense- 
less, it was impossible. 

It was impossible first because as experi- 
ence shows that a three-mile movement of 
columns on a battlefield never coincides with 
the plans the probability of Chichag6v, Kut- 
uzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction on 
time at an appointed place was so remote as 
to be tantamount to impossibility, as in fact 
thought Kutuzov, who when he received the 
plan remarked that diversions planned over 
great distances do not yield the desired re- 
sults. 

Secondly it was impossible, because to para- 
lyze the momentum with which Napoleon's 
army was retiring, incomparably greater forces 
than the Russians possessed would have been 
required. 

Thirdly it was impossible, because the mili- 
tary term "to cut off" has no meaning. One 
can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. 
To cut off an army to bar its road is quite 
impossible, for there is always plenty of room 
to avoid capture and there is the night when 
nothing can be seen, as the military scientists 
might convince themselves by the example of 
Krdsnoe and of the Berezina. It is only pos- 
sible to capture prisoners if they agree to be 
captured, just as it is only possible to catch a 
swallow if it settles on one's hand. Men can 
only be taken prisoners if they surrender ac- 
cording to the rules of strategy and tactics, as 
the Germans did. But the French troops quite 



BOOK FOURTEEN 

rightly did not consider that this suited them, 
since death by hunger and cold awaited them 
in flight or captivity alike. 

Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, be- 
cause never since the world began has a war 
been fought under such conditions as those 
that obtained in 1812, and the Russian army 
in its pursuit of the French strained its strength 
to the utmost and could not have done more 
without destroying itself. 

During the movement of the Russian army 
from Tarutino to Krasnoe it lost fifty thou- 
sand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal 
to the population of a large provincial town. 
Half the men fell out of the army without a 
battle. 

And it is of this period of the campaign- 
when the army lacked boots and sheepskin 
coats, was short of provisions and without 
vodka, and was camping out at night for 
months in the snow with fifteen degrees of 
frost, 1 when there were only seven or eight 
hours of daylight and the rest was night in 
which the influence of discipline cannot be 
maintained, when men were taken into that 
region of death where discipline fails, not for 
a few hours only as in a battle, but for months, 
where they were every moment fighting death 
from hunger and cold, when half the army 
perished in a single monthit is of this period 
of the campaign that the historians tell us how 
Milorddovich should have made a flank march 
to such and such a place, Tormasov to another 
place, and Chichag6v should have crossed 
(more than knee-deep in snow) to somewhere 
else, and how so-and-so "routed" and "cut off" 
the French and so on and so on. 

The Russians, half of whom died, did all 
that could and should have been done to at- 
tain an end worthy of the nation, and they are 
two degrees below zero Fahrenheit. 



6.3

not to blame because other Russians, sitting 
in warm rooms, proposed that they should do 
what was impossible. 

All that strange contradiction now difficult 
to understand between the facts and the his- 
torical accounts only arises because the his- 
torians dealing with the matter have written 
the history of the beautiful words and senti- 
ments of various generals, and not the history 
of the events. 

To them the words of Milordovich seem 
very interesting, and so do their surmises and 
the rewards this or that general received; but 
the question of those fifty thousand men who 
were left in hospitals and in graves does not 
even interest them, for it does not come with- 
in the range of their investigation. 

Yet one need only discard the study of the 
reports and general plans and consider the 
movement of those hundreds of thousands of 
men who took a direct part in the events, and 
all the questions that seemed insoluble easily 
and simply receive an immediate and certain 
solution. 

The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his 
army never existed except in the imaginations 
of a dozen people. It could not exist because 
it was senseless and unattainable. 

The people had a single aim: to free their 
land from invasion. That aim was attained in 
the first place of itself, as the French ran away, 
and so it was only necessary not to stop their 
flight. Secondly it was attained by the guerrilla 
warfare which was destroying the French, and 
thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army 
was following the French, ready to use its 
strength in case their movement stopped. 

The Russian army had to act like a whip 
to a running animal. And the experienced 
driver knew it was better to hold the whip 
raised as a menace than to strike the running 
animal on the head. 



Book Fifteen: 1812-13 



CHAPTER I 

WHEN SEEING a dying animal a man feels a 
sense of horror: substance similar to his own is 
perishing before his eyes. But when it is a be- 
loved and intimate human being that is dying, 
besides this horror at the extinction of life 
there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which 
like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and 
sometimes heals, but always aches and shrinks 
at any external irritating touch. 

After Prince Andrew's death Natdsha and 
Princess Mary alike felt this. Drooping in spirit 
and closing their eyes before the menacing 
cloud of death that overhung them, they dared 
not look life in the face. They carefully guard- 
ed their open wounds from any rough and 
painful contact. Everything: a carriage pass- 
ing rapidly in the street, a summons to dinner, 
the maid's inquiry what dress to prepare, or 
worse still any word of insincere or feeble 
sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully irritated 
the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet 
in which they both tried to listen to the stern 
and dreadful choir that still resounded in their 
imagination, and hindered their gazing into 
those mysterious limitless vistas that for an in- 
stant had opened out before them. 

Only when alone together were they free 
from such outrage and pain. They spoke little 
even to one another, and when they did it was 
of very unimportant matters. 

Both avoided any allusion to the future. 
To admit the possibility of a future seemed to 
them to insult his memory. Still more carefully 
did they avoid anything relating to him who 
was dead. It seemed to them that what they 
had lived through and experienced could not 
be expressed in words, and that any reference 
to the details of his life infringed the majesty 
and sacredness of the mystery that had been 
accomplished before their eyes. 

Continued abstention from speech, and con- 
stant avoidance of everything that might lead 
up to the subject this halting on all sides at 
the boundary of what they might not mention 



brought before their minds with still greater 
purity and clearness what they were both feel- 
ing. 

But pure and complete sorrow is as impos- 
sible as pure and complete joy. Princess Mary, 
in her position as absolute and independent 
arbiter of her own fate and guardian and in- 
structor of her nephew, was the first to be 
called back to life from that realm of sorrow 
in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight. 
She received letters from her relations to which 
she had to reply; the room in which little 
Nicholas had been put was damp and he be- 
gan to cough; Alpatych came to Yaroslavl with 
reports on the state of their affairs and with 
advice and suggestions that they should return 
to Moscow to the house on the Vozdvfzhenka 
Street, which had remained uninjured and 
needed only slight repairs. Life did not stand 
still and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was 
for Princess Mary to emerge from the realm 
of secluded contemplation in which she had 
lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed 
as she felt to leave Natasha alone, yet the cares 
of life demanded her attention and she in- 
voluntarily yielded to them. She went through 
the accounts with Alpatych, conferred with 
Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders 
and made preparations for the journey to 
Moscow. 

Natasha remained alone and, from the time 
Princess Mary began making preparations for 
departure, held aloof from her too. 

Princess Mary asked the countess to let 
Natasha go with her to Moscow, and both par- 
ents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw 
their daughter losing strength every day and 
thought that a change of scene and the advice 
of Moscow doctors would be good for her. 

"I am not going anywhere," Natasha replied 
when this was proposed to her. "Do please just 
leave me alonel" And she ran out of the room, 
with difficulty refraining from tears of vexa- 
tion and irritation rather than of sorrow. 

After she felt herself deserted by Princess 



614 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



615 



Mary and alone in her grief, Natasha spent 
most of the time in her room by herself, sitting 
huddled up feet and all in the corner of the 
sofa, tearing and twisting something with her 
slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and 
fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. 
This solitude exhausted and tormented her 
but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as 
anyone entered she got up quickly, changed 
her position and expression, and picked up a 
book or some sewing, evidently waiting im- 
patiently for the intruder to go. 

She felt all the time as if she might at any 
moment penetrate that on whichwith a ter- 
rible questioning too great for her strength 
her spiritual gaze was fixed. 

One day toward the end of December Natd- 
sha, pale and thin, dressed in a black woolen 
gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into 
a knot, was crouched feet and all in the corner 
of her sofa, nervously crumpling and smooth- 
ing out the end of her sash while she looked 
at a corner of the door. 

She was gazing in the direction in which he 
had gone to the other side of life. And that 
other side of life, of which she had never be- 
fore thought and which had formerly seemed 
to her so far away and improbable, was now 
nearer and more akin and more comprehen- 
sible than this side of life, where everything 
was either emptiness and desolation or suffer- 
ing and indignity. 

She was gazing where she knew him to be; 
but she could not imagine him otherwise than 
as he had been here. She now saw him again as 
he had been at Mytishchi, at Tr6itsa, and at 
Yarosldvl. 

She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated 
his words and her own, and sometimes devised 
other words they might have spoken. 

There he is lying back in an armchair in his 
velvet cloak, leaning his head on his thin pale 
hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his 
shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his 
eyes glitter, and a wrinkle comes and goes on 
his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches just 
perceptibly, but rapidly. Natasha knows that 
he is struggling with terrible pain. "What is 
that pain like? Why does he have that pain? 
What does he feel? How does it hurt him?" 
thought Natasha. He noticed her watching 
him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seri- 
ously: 

"One thing would be terrible," said he: "to 
bind oneself forever to a suffering man. It 
would be continual torture." And he looked 



searchingly at her. Natdsha as usual answered 
before she had time to think what she would 
say. She said: "This can't go on it won't. You 
will get well quite well." 

She now saw him from the commencement 
of that scene and relived what she had then 
felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look 
at those words and understood the meaning of 
the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze. 

"I agreed," Natasha now said to herself, 
"that it would be dreadful if he always con- 
tinued to suffer. I said it then only because it 
would have been dreadful for him, but he 
understood it differently. He thought it would 
be dreadful for me. He then still wished to 
live and feared death. And I said it so awk- 
wardly and stupidly! I did not say what I 
meant. I thought quite differently. Had I said 
what I thought, I should have said: even if he 
had to go on dying, to die continually before 
my eyes, I should have been happy compared 
with what I am now. Now there is nothing . . . 
nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not 
and never will know it. And now it will never, 
never be possible to put it right." And now 
he again seemed to be saying the same words 
to her, only in her imagination Natdsha this 
time gave him a different answer. She stopped 
him and said: "Terrible lor you, but not for 
me! You know that for me there is nothing in 
life but you, and to suffer with you is the great- 
est happiness for me," and he took her hand 
and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible 
evening four days before his death. And in 
her imagination she said other tender and lov- 
ing words whidi she might have said then but 
only spoke now: "I love theel . . . thee! I love, 
love . . ." she said, convulsively pressing her 
hands and setting her teeth with a desperate 
effort. . . . 

She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears 
were already rising in her eyes; then she sud- 
denly asked herself to whom she was saying 
this. Again everything was shrouded in hard, 
dry perplexity, and again with a strained frown 
she peered toward the world where he was. 
And now, now it seemed to her she was pene- 
trating the mystery. . . . But at the instant 
when it seemed that the incomprehensible was 
revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door 
handle struck painfully on her ears. Dunydsha, 
her maid, entered the room quickly and 
abruptly with a frightened look on her face 
and showing no concern for her mistress. 

"Come to your Papa at once, please!" s?id 
she with a strange, excited look. "A misfor-

tune . . . about Peter Ilynich ... a letter/' she 
finished with a sob. 

CHAPTER II 

BESIDES A FEELING of aloofness from everybody 
Natdsha was feeling a special estrangement 
from the members of her own family. All of 
them her father, mother, and S6nya were so 
near to her, so familiar, so commonplace, that 
all their words and feelings seemed an insult 
to the world in which she had been living of 
late, and she felt not merely indifferent to them 
but regarded them with hostility. She heard 
Dunydsha's words about Peter Ilynich and a 
misfortune, but did not grasp them. 

"What misfortune? What misfortune can 
happen to them? They just live their own old, 
quiet, and commonplace life," thought Natd- 
sha. 

As she entered the ballroom her father was 
hurriedly coming out of her mother's room. 
His face was puckered up and wet with tears. 
He had evidently run out of that room to give 
vent to the sobs that were choking him. When 
he saw Natdsha he waved his arms despairingly 
and burst into convulsively painful sobs that 
distorted his soft round face. 

"Pe . . . P^tya . . . Go, go, she ... is call- 
ing . . ." and weeping like a child and quickly 
shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost 
fell into it, covering his face with his hands. 

Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run 
through Natdsha's whole being. Terrible an- 
guish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache 
as if something was being torn inside her and 
she were dying. But the pain was immediately 
followed by a feeling of release from the op- 
pressive constraint that had prevented her 
taking part in life. The sight of her father, the 
terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard 
through the door, made her immediately for- 
get herself and her own grief. 

She ran to her father, but he feebly waved 
his arm, pointing to her mother's door. Prin- 
cess Mary, pal&amp;and with quivering chin, came 
out from that room and taking Natdsha by the 
arm said something to her. Natdsha neither 
saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, 
pausing at the door for an instant as if strug- 
gling with herself, and then ran to her mother. 

The countess was lying in an armchair in a 
strange and awkward position, stretching out 
and beating her head against the wall. S6nya 
and the maids were holding her arms. 

"Natasha! Natdsha! . . ." cried the countess. 
"It's not true . . . it's not true . . , He's ly- 



ing . . . Natdsha!" she shrieked, pushing those 
around her away. "Go away, all of you; it's not 
true! Killed! ... ha, ha, ha! ... It's not true!" 

Natdsha put one knee on the armchair, 
stooped over her mother, embraced her, and 
with unexpected strength raised her, turned 
her face toward herself, and clung to her. 

"Mummy! . . . darling! ... I am here, my 
dearest Mummy," she kept on whispering, not 
pausing an instant. 

She did not let go of her mother but strug- 
gled tenderly with her, demanded a pillow and 
hot water, and unfastened and tore open her 
mother's dress. 

"My dearest darling . . . Mummy, my pre- 
cious! . . ." she whispered incessantly, kissing 
her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her 
own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling 
her nose and cheeks. 

The countess pressed her daughter's hand, 
closed her eyes, and became quiet for a mo- 
ment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed 
swiftness, glanced vacantly around her, and 
seeing Natdsha began to press her daughter's 
head with all her strength. Then she turned 
toward her daughter's face which was wincing 
with pain and gazed long at it. 

"Natdsha, you love me?" she said in a soft 
trustful whisper. "Natdsha, you would not de- 
ceive me? You'll tell me the whole truth?" 

Natdsha looked at her with eyes full of tears 
and in her look there was nothing but love and 
an entreaty for forgiveness. 

"My darling Mummy 1" she repeated, strain- 
ing all the power of her love to find some way 
of taking on herself the excess of grief that 
crushed her mother. 

And again in a futile struggle with reality 
her mother, refusing to believe that she could 
live when her beloved boy was killed in the 
bloom of life, escaped from reality into a 
world of delirium. 

Natdsha did not remember how that day 
passed nor that night, nor the next day and 
night. She did not sleep and did not leave her 
mother. Her persevering and patient love 
seemed completely to surround the countess 
every moment, not explaining or consoling, 
but recalling her to life. 

During the third night the countess kept 
very quiet for a few minutes, and Natdsha 
rested her head on the arm of her chair and 
closed her eyes, but opened them again on 
hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was 
sitting up in bed and speaking softly. 

"How glad I am you have come. You are 



BOOK FIFTEEN 

tired. Won't you have some tea?" Natasha 
went up to her. "You have improved in looks 
and grown more manly/' continued the count- 
ess, taking her daughter's hand. 

"Mammal What are you saying? . . ." 
"Natdsha, he is no more, no more!" 
And embracing her daughter, the countess 
began to weep for the first time.

CHAPTER III 

PRINCESS MARY postponed her departure. S6nya 
and the count tried to replace Natdsha but 
could not. They saw that she alone was able to 
restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. 
For three weeks Natdsha remained constantly 
at her mother's side, sleepingon a lounge chair 
in her room, making her eat and drink, and 
talking to her incessantly because the mere 
sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed 
her mother. 

The mother's wounded spirit could not heal. 
Petya's death had torn from her half her life. 
When the news of Pdtya's death had come she 
had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, 
but a month later she left her room a listless 
old woman taking no interest in life. But the 
same blow that almost killed the countess, this 
second blow, restored Natasha to life. 

A spiritual wound produced by a rending of 
the spiritual body is like a physical wound 
and, strange as it. may seem, just as a deep 
wound may heal and its edges join, physical 
and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal com- 
pletely only as the result of a vital force from 
within. 

Natasha's wound healed in that way. She 
thought her life was ended, but her love for her 
mother unexpectedly showed her that the es- 
sence of life love was still active within her. 
Love awoke and so did life. 

Prince Andrew's last days had bound Prin- 
cess Mary and Natasha together; this new sor- 
row brought them still closer to one another. 
Princess Mary put off her departure, and for 
three weeks looked after Natdsha as if she had 
been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her 
mother's bedroom had strained Natdsha's phys- 
ical strength. 

One afternoon noticing Natasha shivering 
with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own 
room and made her lie down on the bed. Nata- 
sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had 
drawn the blinds and was going away she called 
her back. 

"I don't want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a 
little." 



"You are tiredtry to sleep." 

"No, no. Why did you bring me away? She 
will be asking for me." 

"She is much better. She spoke so well to- 
day," said Princess Mary. 

Natdsha lay on the bed and in the semidark- 
ness of the room scanned Princess Mary's face. 

"Is she like him?" thought Natdsha. "Yes, 
like and yet not like. But she is quite original, 
strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. 
What is in her heart? All that is good. But 
how? What is her mind like? What does she 
think about me? Yes, she is splendid!" 

"Mary," she said timidly, drawing Princess 
Mary's hand to herself, "Mary, you mustn't 
think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love 
you! Let us be quite, quite friends." 

And Natdsha, embracing her, began kissing 
her face and hands, making Princess Mary feel 
shy but happy by this demonstration of her 
feelings. 

From that day a tender and passionate friend- 
ship such as exists only between women was 
established between Princess Mary and Nata- 
sha. They were continually kissing and saying 
tender things to one another and spent most 
of their time together. When one went out the 
other became restless and hastened to rejoin 
her. Together they felt more in harmony with 
one another than either of them felt with her- 
self when alone. A feeling stronger than friend- 
ship sprang up between them; an exclusive 
feeling of life being possible only in each 
other's presence. 

Sometimes they were silent for hours; some- 
times after they were already in bed they would 
begin talking and go on till morning. They 
spoke most of what was long past. Princess 
Mary spoke of her childhood, of her mother, 
her father, and her daydreams; and Natdsha, 
who with a passive lack of understanding had 
formerly turned away from that life of devo- 
tion, submission, and the poetry of Christian 
self-sacrifice, now feeling herself bound to 
Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her 
past too and to understand a side of life pre- 
viously incomprehensible to her. She did not 
think of applying submission and self-abnega- 
tion to her own life, for she was accustomed to 
seek other joys, but she understood and loved 
in another those previously incomprehensible 
virtues. For Princess Mary, listening to Natd- 
sha's tales of childhood and early youth, there 
also opened out a new and hitherto uncom- 
prehended side of life: belief in life and its 
enjoyment.

WAR AND PEACE 



Just as before, they never mentioned him 
so as not to lower (as they thought) their 
exalted feelings by words; but this silence about 
him had the effect of making them gradually 
begin to forget him without being conscious 
of it. 

Natasha had grown thin and pale and phys- 
ically so weak that they all talked about her 
health, and this pleased her. But sometimes 
she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of 
death but of sickness, weakness, and loss of 
good looks, and involuntarily she examined 
her bare arm carefully, surprised at its thin- 
ness, and in the morning noticed her drawn 
and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her 
glass. It seemed to her that things must be so, 
and yet it was dreadfully sad. 

One day she went quickly upstairs and 
found herself out of breath. Unconsciously 
she immediately invented a reason for going 
down, and then, testing her strength, ran up- 
stairs again, observing the result. 

Another time when she called Dunyasha her 
voice trembled, so she called again though 
she could hear Dunydsha coming called her 
in the deep chest tones in which she had been 
wont to sing, and listened attentively to herself. 

She did not know and would not have be- 
lieved it, but beneath the layer of slime that 
covered her soul and seemed to her impene- 
trable, delicate young shoots of grass were al- 
ready sprouting, which taking root would so 
cover with their living verdure the grief that 
weighed her down that it would soon no 
longer be seen or noticed. The wound had be- 
gun to heal from within. 

At the end of January Princess Mary left for 
Moscow, and the count insisted on Natasha's 
going with her to consult the doctors. 

CHAPTER IV 

AFTER THE ENCOUNTER at Vyazma, where Kutii- 
zov had been unable to hold back his troops in 
their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the 
enemy and so on, the farther movement of the 
fleeing French, and of the Russians who pur- 
sued them, continued as far as Krdsnoe with- 
out a battle. The flight was so rapid that the 
Russian army pursuing the French could not 
keep up with them; cavalry and artillery 
horses broke down, and the information re- 
ceived of the movements of the French was 
never reliable. 

The men in the Russian army were so 
worn out by this continuous marching at the 
rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they 



could not go any faster. 

To realize the degree of exhaustion of the 
Russian army it is only necessary to grasp 
clearly the meaning of the fact that, while 
not losing more than five thousand killed and 
wounded after Tarutino and less than a hun- 
dred prisoners, the Russian army which left 
that place a hundred thousand strong reached 
Krdsnoe with only fifty thousand. 

The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just 
as destructive to our army as the flight of the 
French was to theirs. The only difference was 
that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with 
no such threat of destruction as hung over the 
French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left 
behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians 
left behind were among their own people. The 
chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon's army 
was the rapidity of its movement, and a con- 
vincing proof of this is the corresponding de- 
crease of the Russian army. 

Kutiizov as far as was in his power, instead 
of trying to check the movement of the French 
as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian 
army generals, directed his whole activity here, 
as he had done at Tarutino and Vydzma, to 
hastening it on while easing the movement of 
our army. 

But besides this, since the exhaustion and 
enormous diminution of the army caused by 
the rapidity of the advance had become evi- 
dent, another reason for slackening the pace 
and delaying presented itself to Kutiizov. The 
aim of the Russian army was to pursue the 
French. The road the French would take was 
unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on 
their heels the greater distance they had to 
cover. Only by following at some distance 
could one cut across the zigzag path of the 
French. All the artful maneuvers suggested by 
our generals meant fresh movements of the 
army and a lengthening of its marches, where- 
as the only reasonable aim was to shorten those 
marches. To that end Kutiizov's activity was 
directed during the whole campaign from Mos- 
cow to Vilna not casually or intermittently 
but so consistently that he never once deviated 
from it. 

Kutiizov felt and knew not by reasoning or 
science but with the whole of his Russian be- 
ingwhat every Russian soldier felt: that the 
French were beaten, that the enemy was flying 
and must be driven out; but at the same time 
he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of 
this march, the rapidity of which was unparal- 
leled for such a time of year. 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



619 



But to the generals, especially the foreign 
ones in the Russian army, who wished to dis- 
tinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, 
and for some reason to capture a king or a 
duke it seemed that now when any battle 
must be horrible and senseless was the very 
time to fight and conquer somebody. Kutuzov 
merely shrugged his shoulders when one after 
another they presented projects of maneuvers 
to be made with those soldiers ill-shod, in- 
sufficiently clad, and half starved who within 
a month and without fighting a battle had 
dwindled to half their number, and who at 
the best if the flight continued would have to 
go a greater distance than that they had already 
traversed, before they reached the frontier. 

This longing to distinguish themselves, to 
maneuver, to overthrow, and to cut off showed 
itself particularly whenever the Russians stum- 
bled on the French army. 

So it was at Krasnoe, where they expected to 
find one of the three French columns and 
stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with 
sixteen thousand men. Despite all Kutuzov's 
efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to 
preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken 
mob of French soldiers by worn-out Russians 
continued at Krasnoe for three days. 

Toll wrote a disposition: "The first column 
will march to so and so," etc. And as usual 
nothing happened in accord with the disposi- 
tion. Prince Eugene of Wiirttemberg fired 
from a hill over the French crowds that were 
running past, and demanded reinforcements 
which did not arrive. The French, avoiding 
the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves in 
the forest by night, making their way round 
as best they could, and continued their flight. 

Miloradovich, who said he did not want to 
know anything about the commissariat affairs 
of his detachment, and could never be found 
when he was wanted that chevalier sans peur 
et sans reproche 1 as he styled himself who 
was fond of parleys with the French, sent en- 
voys demanding their surrender, wasted time, 
and did not do what he was ordered to do. 

"I give you that column, lads," he said, rid- 
ing up to the troops and pointing out the 
French to the cavalry. 

And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urg- 
ing on horses that could scarcely move, trotted 
with much effort to the column presented to 
them that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen 
stark with cold, frost-bitten, and starving and 
the column that had been presented to them 

1 Knight without fear and without reproach. 



threw down its arms and surrendered as it had 
long been anxious to do. 

At Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand 
prisoners, several hundred cannon, and a stick 
called a "marshal's staff," and disputed as 
to who had distinguished himself and were 
pleased with their achievement though they 
much regretted not having taken Napoleon, 
or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort, 
and reproached one another and especially 
Kutuzov for having failed to do so. 

These men, carried away by their passions, 
were but blind tools of the most melancholy 
law of necessity, but considered themselves 
heroes and imagined that they were accom- 
plishing a most noble and honorable deed. 
They blamed Kutuzov and said that from the 
very beginning of the campaign he had pre- 
vented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he 
thought of nothing but satisfying his passions 
and would not advance from the Linen Fac- 
tories because he was comfortable there, that 
at Krasnoe he checked the advance because 
on learning that Napoleon was there he had 
quite lost his head, and that it was probable 
that he had an understanding with Napoleon 
and had been bribed by him," and so on, and 
so on. 

Not only did his contemporaries, carried 
away by their passions, talk in this way, but 
posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon 
as grand, while Kutuzov is described by for- 
eigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak old courtier, 
and by Russians as something indefinite a 
sort of puppet useful only because he had a 
Russian name. 

CHAPTER V 

IN 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openly accused 
of blundering. The Emperor was dissatisfied 
with him. And in a history recently written by 
order of the Highest Authorities it is said that 
Kutuzov was a cunning court liar, frightened 
of the name of Napoleon, and that by his 
blunders at Krasnoe and the Berezina he de- 
prived the Russian army of the glory of com- 
plete victory over the French. 8 

Such is the fate not of great men (grands 
hommes) whom the Russian mind does not 
acknowledge, but of those rare and always soli-

tary individuals who, discerning the will of 
Providence, submit their personal will to it. 
The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish 
such men for discerning the higher laws. 

For Russian historians, strange and terrible 
to say, Napoleon that most insignificant tool 
of history who never anywhere, even in exile, 
showed human dignity Napoleon is the ob- 
ject of adulation and enthusiasm; he is grand. 
But Kutiizov the man who from the begin- 
ning to the end of his activity in 1812, never 
once swerving by word or deed from Borodin6 
to Vilna, presented an example exceptional in 
history of self-sacrifice and a present conscious- 
ness of the future importance of what was 
happening Kutiizov seems to them something 
indefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of 
him and of the year 1812 they always seem a 
little ashamed. 

And yet it is difficult to imagine an histori- 
cal character whose activity was so unswerv- 
ingly directed to a single aim; and it would be 
difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or 
more consonant with the will of the whole 
people. Still more difficult would it be to find 
an instance in history of the aim of an his- 
torical personage being so completely accom- 
plished as that to which all Kutiizov's efforts 
were directed in 1812. 

Kutiizov never talked of "forty centuries 
looking down from the Pyramids," of the sac- 
rifices he offered for the fatherland, or of 
what he intended to accomplish or had ac- 
complished; in general he said nothing about 
himself, adopted no prose, always appeared to 
be the simplest and most ordinary of men, and 
said the simplest and most ordinary things. 
He wrote letters to his daughters and to Ma- 
dame de Stael, read novels, liked the society of 
pretty women, jested with generals, officers, and 
soldiers, and never contradicted those who 
tried to prove anything to him. When Count 
Rostopchin at the Yaiiza bridge galloped up to 
Kutiizov with personal reproaches for having 
caused the destruction of Moscow, and said: 
"How was it you promised not to abandon 
Moscow without a battle?" Kutiizov replied: 
"And I shall not abandon Moscow without a 
battle," though Moscow was then already aban- 
doned. When Arakch^ev, coming to him from 
the Emperor, said that Erm61ov ought to be 
appointed chief of the artillery, Kutiizov re- 
plied: "Yes, I was justsayingso myself," though 
a moment before he had said quite the con- 
trary. What did it matter to him who then 
alone amid a senseless crowd understood the 



whole tremendous significance of what was 
happening what did it matter to him whether 
Rostopchin attributed the calamities of Mos- 
cow to him or to himself? Still less could it 
matter to him who was appointed chief of the 
artillery. 

Not merely in these cases but continually 
did that old man who by experience of life 
had reached the conviction that thoughts and 
the words serving as their expression are not 
what move people use quite meaningless 
words that happened to enter his head. 

But that man, so heedless of his words, did 
not once during the whole time of his activity 
utter one word inconsistent with the single 
aim toward which he moved throughout the 
whole war. Obviously in spite of himself, in 
very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly ex- 
pressed his real thoughts with the bitter con- 
viction that he would not be understood. Be- 
ginning with the battle of Borodin6, from 
which time his disagreement with those about 
him began, he alone said that the battle of 
Borodind was a victory, and repeated this 
both verbally and in his dispatches and re- 
ports up to the time of his death. He alone 
said that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of 
Russia. In reply to Lauriston's proposal of 
peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such 
is the people's will. He alone during the re- 
treat of the French said that all our maneuvers 
are useless, everything is being accomplished 
of itself better than we could desire; that the 
enemy must be offered "a golden bridge"; that 
neither the Tarutino, the Vyazma, nor the 
Krdsnoe battles were necessary; that we must 
keep some force to reach the frontier with, 
and that he would not sacrifice a single Rus- 
sian for ten Frenchmen. 

And this courtier, as he is described to us, 
who lies to Arakchdev to please the Emperor, 
he alone incurring thereby the Emperor's 
displeasure said in Vflna that to carry the 
war beyond the frontier is useless and harm- 
ful. 

Nor do words alone prove that only he 
understood the meaning of the events. His 
actions without the smallest deviation were 
all directed to one and the same threefold end: 
(i) to brace all his strength for conflict with 
the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive 
them out of Russia, minimizing as far as pos- 
sible the sufferings of our people and of our 
army. 

This procrastinator Kutiizov, whose motto 
was "Patience and Time," this enemy of de- 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



621 



cisive action, gave battle at Borodin6, invest- 
ing the preparations for it with unparalleled 
solemnity. This Kuttizov who before the battle 
of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, 
he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, de- 
clared till his death that Borodin6 was a vic- 
tory, despite the assurance of generals that 
the battle was lost and despite the fact that 
for an army to have to retire after winning 
a battle was unprecedented. He alone during 
the whole retreat insisted that battles, which 
were useless then, should not be fought, and 
that a new war should not be begun nor the 
frontiers of Russia crossed. 

It is easy now to understand the significance 
of these events if only we abstain from at- 
tributing to the activity of the mass aims that 
existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals 
for the events and their results now lie be- 
fore us. 

But how did that old man, alone, in opposi- 
tion to the general opinion, so truly discern 
the importance of the people's view of the 
events that in all his activity he was never 
once untrue to it? 

The source of that extraordinary power of 
penetrating the meaning of the events then 
occuring lay in the national feeling which he 
possessed in full purity and strength. 

Only the recognition of the fact that he pos- 
sessed this feeling caused the people in so 
strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar's wish, 
to select him an old man in disfavor to be 
their representative in the national war. And 
only that feeling placed him on that highest 
human pedestal from which he, the command- 
er in chief, devoted all his powers not to slay- 
ing and destroying men but to saving and 
showing pity on them. 

That simple, modest, and therefore truly 
great, figure could not be cast in the false 
mold of a European hero the supposed ruler 
of men that history has invented. 

To a lackey no man can be great, for a 
lackey has his own conception of greatness. 

CHAPTER VI 

THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER was the first day of 
what is called the battle of Krasnoe. Toward 
evening after much disputing and many mis- 
takes made by generals who did not go to 
their proper places, and after adjutants had 
been sent about with counterorders when it 
had become plain that the enemy was every- 
where in flight and that there could and would 
be no battle, Kutuzov left Krdsnoe and went 



to D6broe whither his headquarters had that 
day been transferred. 

The day was clear and frosty. Kutuzov rode 
to Dobroe on his plump little white horse, fol- 
lowed by an enormous suite of discontented 
generals who whispered among themselves be- 
hind his back. All along the road groups of 
French prisoners captured that day (there 
were seven thousand of them) were crowding 
to warm themselves at campfires. Near D6broe 
an immense crowd of tattered prisoners, buzz- 
ing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in 
anything they had been able to get hold of, 
were standing in the road beside a long row 
of unharnessed French guns. At the approach 
of the commander in chief the buzz of talk 
ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov 
who, wearing a white cap with a red band and 
a padded overcoat that bulged on his round 
shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his 
white horse. One of the generals was reporting 
to him where the guns and prisoners had been 
captured. 

Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not 
listen to what the general was saying. He 
screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as 
he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prison- 
ers, who presented a specially wretched ap- 
pearance. Most of them were disfigured by 
frost-bitten noses and cheeks, and nearly all 
had red, swollen, and festering eyes. 

One group of the French stood close to the 
road, and two of them, one of whom had his 
face covered with sores, were tearing a piece 
of raw flesh with their hands. There was some- 
thing horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance 
they threw at the riders and in the malevolent 
expression with which, after a glance at Kutu- 
zov, the soldier with the sores immediately 
turned away and went on with what he was 
doing. 

Kutuzov looked long and intently at these 
two soldiers. He puckered his face, screwed 
up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At 
another spot he noticed a Russian soldier 
laughingly patting a Frenchman on the 
shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly 
manner, and Kutuzov with the same expres- 
sion on his face again swayed his head. 

"What were you saying?" he asked the gen- 
eral, who continuing his report directed the 
commander in chief's attention to some stand- 
ards captured from the French and standing 
in front of the Preobrazh^nsk regiment. 

"Ah, the standards! "said Kutiizov, evidently 
detaching himself with difficulty from the 



622 



WAR AND PEACE 



thoughts that preoccupied him. 

He looked about him absently. Thousands of 
eyes were looking at him from all sides await- 
ing a word from him. 

He stopped in front of the Preobrazh^nsk 
regiment, sighed deeply, and closed his eyes. 
One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carry- 
ing the standards to advance and surround the 
commander in chief with them. Kutuzov was 
silent for a few seconds and then, submitting 
with evident reluctance to the duty imposed 
by his position, raised his head and began to 
speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He 
looked attentively around at the circle of 
officers, recognizing several of them. 

"I thank you all!" he said, addressing the 
soldiers and then again the officers. In the still- 
ness around him his slowly uttered words were 
distinctly heard. "I thank you all for your hard 
and faithful service. The victory is complete 
and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you 
forever." 

He paused and looked round. 

"Lower its head, lower it!" he said to a 
soldier who had accidentally lowered the 
French eagle he was holding before the Pre- 
obrazhensk standards. "Lower, lower, that's it. 
Hurrah, lads!" he added, addressing the men 
with a rapid movement of his chin. 

"Hur-r-rahl" roared thousands of voices. 

While the soldiers were shouting Kutuzov 
leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his 
head, and his eye lit up with a mild and ap- 
parently ironic gleam. 

"You see, brothers . . ." said he when the 
shouts had ceased . . . and all at once his voice 
and the expression of his face changed. It was 
no longer the commander in chief speaking 
but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell 
his comrades something very important. 

There was a stir among the throng of officers 
and in the ranks of the soldiers, who moved 
that they might hear better what he was going 
to say. 

"You see, brothers, I know it's hard for you, 
but it can't be helped! Bear up; it won't be 
for long now! We'll see our visitors off and 
then we'll rest. The Tsar won't forget your 
service. It is hard for you, but still you are at 
home while they you see what they have come 
to," said he, pointing to the prisoners. "Worse 
off than our poorest beggars. While they were 
strong we didn't spare ourselves, but now we 
may even pity them. They are human beings 
too. Isn't it so, lads?" 

He looked around, and in the direct, re- 



spectful, wondering gaze fixed upon him he 
read sympathy with what he had said. His face 
grew brighter and brighter with an old man's 
mild smile, which drew the corners of his lips 
and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased 
speaking and bowed his head as if in per- 
plexity. 

"But after all who asked them here? Serves 
them right, the bloody bastards!" he cried, sud- 
denly lifting his head. 

And flourishing his whip he rode off at a 
gallop for the first time during the whole 
campaign, and left the broken ranks of the 
soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting "Hur- 
rah!" 

Kutuzov's words were hardly understood by 
the troops. No one could have repeated the 
field marshal's address, begun solemnly and 
then changing into an old man's simplehearted 
talk; but the hearty sincerity of that speech, 
the feeling of majestic triumph combined with 
pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice 
of our cause, exactly expressed by that old 
man's good-natured expletives, was not merely 
understood but lay in the soul of every soldier 
and found expression in their joyous and 
long-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one 
of the generals addressed Kutuzov asking 
whether he wished his caliche to be sent for, 
Kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a 
sob, being evidently greatly moved. 

CHAPTER VII 

WHEN THE TROOPS reached their night's halt- 
ing place on the eighth of November, the last 
day of the Krdsnoe battles, it was already grow- 
ing dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty 
with occasional lightly falling snow and to- 
ward evening it began to clear. Through the 
falling snow a purple-black and starry sky 
showed itself and the frost grew keener. 

An infantry regiment which had left Taru- 
tino three thousand strong but now numbered 
only nine hundred was one of the first to 
arrive that night at its halting place a village 
on the highroad. The quartermasters who 
met the regiment announced that all the huts 
were full of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalry- 
men, and members of the staff. There was on- 
ly one hut available for the regimental com- 
mander. 

The commander rode up to his hut. The 
regiment passed through the village and 
stacked its arms in front of the last huts. 

Like some huge many-limbed animal, the 
regiment began to prepare its lair and its food. 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



623 



One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep 
through the snow into a birch forest to the 
right of the village, and immediately the sound 
of axes and swords, the crashing of branches, 
and merry voices could be heard from there. 
Another section amid the regimental wagons 
and horses which were standing in a group was 
busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and 
feeding the horses. A third section scattered 
through the village arranging quarters for the 
staff officers, carrying out the French corpses 
that were in the huts, and dragging away 
boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, 
for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve for 
shelter. 

Some fifteen men with merry shouts were 
shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed, 
the roof of which had already been removed. 

"Now then, all togethershovel" cried the 
voices, and the huge surface of the wall, 
sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, 
was seen swaying in the gloom of the night. 
The lower stakes cracked more and more and 
at last the wall fell, and with it the men who 
had been pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter 
and joyous shouts ensued. 

"Now then, catch hold in twosl Hand up 
the lever 1 That's it. ... Where are you shoving 
to?" 

"Now, all together! But wait a moment, 
boys . . . With a song!" 

All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety 
voice began to sing. At the end of the third 
verse as the last note died away, twenty voices 
roared out at once: "Oo-oo-oo-oo! That's it. 
All together! Heave away, boys! . . ." but de- 
spite their united efforts the wattle hardly 
moved, and in the silence that followed the 
heavy breathing of the men was audible. 

"Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils 
that you are! Lend a hand . . . will you? You 
may want us one of these days." 

Some twenty men of the Sixth Company 
who were on their way into the village joined 
the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was 
about thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, 
moved forward along the village street, sway- 
ing, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders 
of the gasping men. 

"Get along . . . Falling? What are you stop- 
ping for? There now. ..." 

Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely. 

"What are you up to?" suddenly came the 
authoritative voice of a sergeant major who 
came upon the men who were hauling their 
burden. "There are gentry here; the general 



himself is in that hut, and you foul-mouthed 
devils, you brutes, I'll give it to youl" shouted 
he, hitting the first man who came in his way 
a swinging blow on the back. "Can't you make 
less noise?" 

The men became silent. The soldier who 
had been struck groaned and wiped his face, 
which had been scratched till it bled by his 
falling against the wattle. 

"There, how that devil hits out! He's made 
my face all bloody," said he in a frightened 
whisper when the sergeant major had passed 
on. 

"Don't you like it?" said a laughing voice, 
and moderating their tones the men moved 
forward. 

When they were out of the village they be- 
gan talking again as loud as before, interlard- 
ing their talk with the same aimless exple- 
tives. 

In the hut which the men had passed, the 
chief officers had gathered and were in ani- 
mated talk over their tea about the events of 
the day and the maneuvers suggested for to- 
morrow. It was proposed to make a flank 
march to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) 
and capture him. 

By the time the soldiers had dragged the 
wattle fence to its place the campfires were 
blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the 
wood crackled, the snow was melting, and 
black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all 
over the occupied space where the snow had 
been trodden down. 

Axes and choppers were plied all around. 
Everything was done without any orders be- 
ing given. Stores of wood were brought for 
the night, shelters were rigged up for the 
officers, caldrons were being boiled, and mus- 
kets and accouterments put in order. 

The wattle wall the men had brought was 
set up in a semicircle by the Eighth Company 
as a shelter from the north, propped up by 
musket rests, and a campfire was built before 
it. They beat the tattoo, called the roll, had 
supper, and settled down round the fires for 
the night some repairing their footgear, some 
smoking pipes, and some stripping themselves 
naked to steam the lice out of their shirts. 

CHAPTER VIII 

ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT that under the al- 
most incredibly wretched conditions the Rus- 
sian soldiers were in at that timelacking 
warm boots and sheepskin coats, without a 
roof over their heads, in the snow with eighteen 



624 



degrees of frost, 1 and without even full rations 
(the commissariat did not always keep up 
with the troops) they would have presented 
a very sad and depressing spectacle. 

On the contrary, the army had never under 
the best material conditions presented a more 
cheerful and animated aspect. This was be- 
cause all who began to grow depressed or who 
lost strength were sifted out of the army day 
by day. All the physically or morally weak had 
long since been left behind and only the 
flower of the army physically and mentally- 
remained. 

More men collected behind the wattle fence 
of the Eighth Company than anywhere else. 
Two sergeants major were sitting with them 
and their campfire blazed brighter than the 
others. For leave to sit by their wattle they de- 
manded contributions of fuel. 

"Eh, Makdev! What has become of you, you 
Son of a bitch? Are you lost or have the wolves 
eaten you? Fetch some more wood!" shouted 
a red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up 
his eyes and blinking because of the smoke 
but not moving back from the fire. "And you, 
Jackdaw, go and fetch some wood I" said he 
to another soldier. 

This red-haired man was neither a sergeant 
nor a corporal, but being robust he ordered 
about those weaker than himself. The soldier 
they called "Jackdaw," a thin little fellow 
with a sharp nose, rose obediently and was 
about to go but at that instant there came into 
the light of the fire the slender, handsome 
figure of a young soldier carrying a load of 
wood. 

"Bring it here that's fine!" 

They split up the wood, pressed it down on 
the fire, blew at it with their mouths, and 
fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, 
making the flames hiss and crackle. The men 
drew nearer and lit their pipes. The handsome 
young soldier who had brought the wood, 
setting his arms akimbo, began stamping his 
cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where 
he stood. 

"Mother! The dew is cold but clear It's 

well that I'm a musketeer . . ." he sang, pre- 
tending to hiccough after each syllable. 

"Look out, your soles will fly off!" shouted 
the red-haired man, noticing that the sole of 
the dancer's boot was hanging loose. "What a 
fellow you are for dancing!" 

The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose

piece of leather, and threw it on the fire. 

"Right enough, friend," said he, and, hav- 
ing sat down, took out of his knapsack a scrap 
of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round 
his foot. "It's the steam that spoils them," he 
added, stretching out his feet toward the fire. 

"They'll soon be issuing us new ones. They 
say that when we've finished hammering them, 
we're to receive double kits!" 

"And that son of a bitch Petr6v has lagged 
behind after all, it seems," said one sergeant 
major. 

"I've had an eye on him this long while," 
said the other. 

"Well, he's a poor sort of soldier. . . ." 

"But in the Third Company they say nine 
men were missing yesterday." 

"Yes, it's all very well, but when a man's 
feet are frozen how can he walk?" 

"Eh? Don't talk nonsense!" said a sergeant 
major. 

"Do you want to be doing the same?" said 
an old soldier, turning reproachfully to the 
man who had spoken of frozen feet. 

"Well, you know," said the sharp-nosed man 
they called Jackdaw in a squeaky and un- 
steady voice, raising himself at the other side 
of the fire, "a plump man gets thin, but for a 
thin one it's death. Take me, now! I've got no 
strength left," he added, with sudden resolu- 
tion turning to the sergeant major. "Tell them 
to send me to hospital; I'm aching all over; 
anyway I shan't be able to keep up." 

"That'll do, that'll do!" replied the sergeant 
major quietly. 

The soldier said no more and the talk went 



"What a lot of those Frenchies were taken 
today, and the fact is that not one of them 
had what you might call real boots on," said a 
soldier, starting a new theme. "They were no 
more than make-believes." 

"The Cossacks have taken their boots. They 
were clearing the hut for the colonel and 
carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, 
boys," put in the dancer. "As they turned 
them over one seemed still alive and, would 
you believe it, he jabbered something in their 
lingo." 

"But they're a clean folk, lads," the first 
man went on; "he was white as white as 
birchbark and some of them are such fine 
fellows, you might think they were nobles." 

"Well, what do you think? They make 
soldiers of all classes there." 

"But they don't understand our talk at all/' 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



625 



&gt;aid the dancer with a puzzled smile. "I asked 
lim whose subject he was, and he jabbered in 
lis own way. A queer lot!" 

"But it's strange, friends," continued the 
nan who had wondered at their whiteness, "the 
peasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when 
:hey began burying the dead where the bat- 
Lie was you know well, those dead had been 
lying there for nearly a month, and says the 
peasant, 'they lie as white as paper, clean, and 
not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.' " 

"Was it from the cold?" asked someone. 

"You're a clever fellow! From the cold in- 
deed! Why, it was hot. If it had been from the 
cold, ours would not have rotted either. 'But,' 
he says, 'go up to ours and they are all rotten 
and maggoty. So/ he says, 'we tie our faces up 
with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we 
drag them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,' 
he says, 'are white as paper and not so much 
smell as a whiff of gunpowder.' " 

All were silent. 

"It must be from their food," said the ser- 
geant major. "They used to gobble the same 
food as the gentry." 

No one contradicted him. 

"That peasant near Mozhdysk where the 
battle was said the men were all called up 
from ten villages around and they carted for 
twenty days and still didn't finish carting the 
dead away. And as for the wolves, he says . . ." 

"That was a real battle," said an old soldier. 
"It's the only one worth remembering; but 
since that . . . it's only been tormenting folk." 

"And do you know, Daddy, the day before 
yesterday we ran at them and, my word, 
they didn't let us get near before they just 
threw down their muskets and went on their 
knees. 'Pardon!' they say. That's only one case. 
They say Pldtov took 'Poleon himself twice. 
But he didn't know the right charm. He 
catches him and catches him no good! He 
turns into a bird in his hands and Hies away. 
And there's no way of killing him either." 

"You're a first-class liar, Kiselev, when I 
come to look at you!" 

"Liar, indeed! It's the real truth." 

"If he fell into my hands, when I'd caught 
him I'd bury him in the ground with an aspen 
stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he's 
ruined!" 

"Well, anyhow we're going to end it. He 
won't come here again," remarked the old 
soldier, yawning. 

The conversation flagged, and the soldiers 
began settling down to sleep. 



"Look at the stars. It's wonderful how they 
shine! You would think the women had spread 
out their linen," said one of the men, gazing 
with admiration at the Milky Way. 

"That's a sign of a good harvest next year." 

"We shall want some more wood." 

"You warm your back and your belly gets 
frozen. That's queer." 

"O Lord!" 

"What are you pushing for? Is the fire only 
for you? Look how he's sprawling!" 

In the silence that ensued, the snoring of 
those who had fallen asleep could be heard. 
Others turned over and warmed themselves, 
now and again exchanging a few words. From 
a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound 
of general, merry laughter. 

"Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth 
Company!" said one of the soldiers, "and 
what a lot of them there are!" 

One of the men got up and went over to the 
Fifth Company. 

"They're having such fun," said he, coming 
back. "Two Frenchies have turned up. One's 
quite frozen and the other's an awful swag- 
gerer. He's singing songs. . . ." 

"Oh, I'll go across and have a look. . . ." 

And several of the men went over to the 
Fifth Company. 

CHAPTER IX 

THE FIFTH COMPANY was bivouacking at the 
very edge of the forest. A huge campfire was 
blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, 
lighting up the branches of trees heavy with 
hoarfrost. 

About midnight they heard the sound of 
steps in the snow of the forest, and the crack- 
ling of dry branches. 

"A bear, lads," said one of the men. 

They all raised their heads to listen, and out 
of the forest into the bright firelight stepped 
two strangely clad human figures clinging to 
one another. 

These were two Frenchmen who had been 
hiding in t^e forest. They came up to the fire, 
hoarsely uttering something in a language our 
soldiers did not understand. One was taller 
than the other; he wore an officer's hat and 
seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the 
fire he had been going to sit down, but fell. 
The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl 
tied round his head, was stronger. He raised 
his companion and said something, pointing 
to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the 
Frenchmen, spread a greatcoat on the ground 



6*6 



WAR AND PEACE 



for the sick man, and brought some buck wheat 
porridge and vodka for both of them. 

The exhausted French officer was Ramballe 
and the man with his head wrapped in the 
shawl was Morel, his orderly. 

When Morel had drunk some vodka and 
finished his bowl of porridge he suddenly be- 
came unnaturally merry and chattered inces- 
santly to the soldiers, who could not under- 
stand him. Ramballe refused food and rest- 
ing his head on his elbow lay silent beside the 
campfire, looking at the Russian soldiers with 
red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted 
a long-drawn groan and then again became 
silent. Morel, pointing to his shoulders, tried 
to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ram- 
balle was an officer and ought to be warmed. 
A Russian officer who had come up to the fire 
sent to ask his colonel whether he would not 
take a French officer into his hut to warm him, 
and when the messenger returned and said 
that the colonel wished the officer to be 
brought to him, Ramballe was told to go. He 
rose and tried to walk, but staggered and 
would have fallen had not a soldier standing 
by held him up. 

"You won't do it again, eh?" said one of the 
soldiers, winking and turning mockingly to 
Ramballe. 

"Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that 
you are a real peasant!" came rebukes from 
all sides addressed to the jesting soldier. 

They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on 
the crossed arms of two soldiers, and carried 
him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around 
their necks while they carried him and began 
wailing plaintively: 

"Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! 
These are men! Oh, my brave, kind friends," 
and he leaned his head against the shoulder 
of one of the men like a child. 

Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best 
place by the fire, surrounded by the soldiers. 

Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with in- 
flamed and streaming eyes, was wearing a 
woman's cloak and had a shawl yed woman 
fashion round his head over his cap. He was 
evidently tipsy, and was singing a French 
song in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm 
thrown round the nearest soldier. The soldiers 
simply held their sides as they watched him. 

"Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! 
I'll soon pick it up. How is it?" said the man 
a singer and a wag whom Morel was embrac- 
ing. 

"Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi vaillant!" 



sang Morel, winking. "Ce diable &amp; quatre . . ." * 

"Vivarikal Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!" re- 
peated the soldier, flourishing his arm and 
really catching the tune. 

"Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!" rose their rough, joy- 
ous laughter from all sides. 

Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too. 

"Well, go on, go on!" 

"Qui eut le triple talent, 
De boire, de battre, 
Et d'etre un vert galant . . ." 2 

"It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, ZaletAev!" 

"Ke . . ." Zaletaev brought out with effort: 
"ke-e-e-e," he drawled, laboriously pursing 
his lips, "le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e de-tra-va- 
ga-la!" he sang. 

"Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! 
Do you want some more to eat?" 

"Give him some porridge: it takes a long 
time to get filled up after starving." 

They gave him some more porridge and 
Morel with a laugh set to work on his third 
bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as 
they watched him. The older men, who thought 
it undignified to amuse themselves with such 
nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side 
of the fire, but one would occasionally raise 
himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with 
a smile. 

"They are men too," said one of them as he 
wrapped himself up in his coat. "Even worm- 
wood grows on its own root." 

"O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tre- 
mendous! That means a hard frost. . . ." 

They all grew silent. The stars, as if know- 
ing that no one was looking at them, began 
to disport themselves in the dark sky: now 
flaring up, now vanishing, now trembling, 
they were busy whispering something glad- 
some and mysterious to one another. 

CHAPTER X 

THE FRENCH ARMY melted away at the uni- 
form rate of a mathematical progression; and 
that crossing of the Bere/ina about which so 
much has been written was only one inter- 
mediate stage in its destruction, and not at 
all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so 
much has been and still is written about the 
Berezina, on the French side this is only be- 

1 "Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! 
That rowdy devil." 

* Who had a triple talent 
For drinking, for fighting, 
And for being a gallant old boy . . . 



BOOK FIFTEEN 

cause at the broken bridge across that river 
the calamities their army had been previously 
enduring were suddenly concentrated at one 
moment into a tragic spectacle that remained 
in every memory, and on the Russian side 
merely because in Petersburg far from the 
seat of war a plan (again one of Pfuel's) had 
been devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic 
trap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured 
himself that all would happen according to 
plan, and therefore insisted that it was just 
the crossing of the Berezina that destroyed the 
French army. In reality the results of the cross- 
ing were much less disastrous to the French 
in guns and men lost than Krasnoe had been, 
as the figures show. 

The sole importance of the crossing of the 
Berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and 
indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans 
for cutting off the enemy's retreat and the 
soundness of the only possible line of action 
the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the 
army demanded namely, simply to follow the 
enemy up. The French crowd fled at a con- 
tinually increasing speed and all its energy 
was directed to reaching its goal. It fled like a 
wounded animal and it was impossible to 
block its path. This was shown not so much 
by the arrangements it made for crossing as 
by what took place at the bridges. When the 
bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people 
from Moscow and women with children who 
were with the French transport, all carried 
on by vis inertiapressed forward into boats 
and into the ice-covered water and did not 
surrender. 

That impulse was reasonable. The condi- 
tion of fugitives and of pursuers was equally 
bad. As long as they remained with their own 
people each might hope for help from his 
fellows and the definite place he held among 
them. But those who surrendered, while re- 
maining in the same pitiful plight, would be 
on a lower level to claim a share in the necessi- 
ties of life. The French did not need to be in- 
formed of the fact that half the prisoners 
with whom the Russians did not know what to 
do perished of cold and hunger despite their 
captors' desire to save them; they felt that it 
could not be otherwise. The most compassion- 
ate Russian commanders, those favorable to 
the French and even the Frenchmen in the 
Russian service could do nothing for the 
prisoners. The French perished from the con- 
ditions to which the Russian army was itself 
exposed. It was impossible to 'take bread and 



627 

clothes from our hungry and indispensable 
soldiers to give to the French who, though not 
harmful, or hated, or guilty, were simply un- 
necessary. Some Russians even did that, but 
they were exceptions. 

Certain destruction lay behind the French 
but in front there was hope. Their ships had 
been burned, there was no salvation save in 
collective flight, and on that the wholestrength 
of the French was concentrated. 

The farther they fled the more wretched be- 
came the plight of the remnant, especially after 
the Berezina, on which (in consequence of 
the Petersburg plan) special hopes had been 
placed by the Russians, and the keener grew 
the passions of the Russian commanders, who 
blamed one another and Kutuzov most of all. 
Anticipation that the failure of the Petersburg 
Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov 
led to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, 
more and more strongly expressed. The ridi- 
cule and contempt were of course expressed in 
a respectful form, making it impossible for 
him to ask wherein he was to blame. They did 
not talk seriously to him; when reporting to 
him or asking for his sanction they appeared 
to be fulfilling a regrettable formality, but 
they winked behind his back and tried to mis- 
lead him at every turn. 

Because they could not understand him all 
these people assumed that it was useless to 
talk to the old man; that he would never grasp 
the profundity of their plans, that he would 
answer with his phrases (which they thought 
were mere phrases) about a "golden bridge," 
about the impossibility of crossing the frontier 
with a crowd of tatterdemalions, and so forth. 
They had heard all that before. And all he 
said that it was necessary to await provisions, 
or that the men had no boots was so simple, 
while what they proposed was so complicated 
and clever, that it was evident that he was old 
and stupid and that they, though not in power, 
were commanders of genius. 

After the junction with the army of the 
brilliant admiral and Petersburg hero Witt- 
genstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff 
reached their maximum. Kutuzov saw this 
and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders. 
Only once, after the affair of the Berezina, did 
he get angry and write to Bennigsen (who re- 
ported separately to the Emperor) the follow- 
ing letter: 

"On account of your spells of ill health, will 
your excellency please be so good as to set off 
for Kaluga on receipt of this, and there await 



6 2 8

further commands and appointments from 
His Imperial Majesty." 

But after Bennigsen's departure, the Grand 
Duke Tsarvich Constantine Pdvlovich joined 
the army. He had taken part in the beginning 
of the campaign but had subsequently been 
removed from the army by Kutiizov. Now hav- 
ing come to the army, he informed Kutiizov 
of the Emperor's displeasure at the poor suc- 
cess of our forces and the slowness of their 
advance. The Emperor intended to join the 
army personally in a few days' time. 

The old man, experienced in court as well 
as in military affairs this same Kutuzov who 
in August had been chosen commander in 
chief against the sovereign's wishes and who 
had removed the Grand Duke and heir- 
apparent from the armywho on his own 
authority and contrary to the Emperor's will 
had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, 
now realized at once that his day was over, 
that his part was played, and that the power 
he was supposed to hold was no longer his. 
And he understood this not merely from the 
attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand 
that the military business in which he had 
played his part was ended and felt that his 
mission was accomplished; and at the same 
time he began to be conscious of the physical 
weariness of his aged body and of the necessity 
of physical rest. 

On the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov 
entered Vflna his "dear Vilna" as he called it. 
Twice during his career Kutuzov had been 
governor of Vilna. In that wealthy town, which 
had not been injured, he found old friends 
and associations, besides the comforts of life 
of which he had so long been deprived. And 
he suddenly turned from the cares of anny 
and state and, as far as the passions that seethed 
around him allowed, immersed himself in the 
quiet life to which he had formerly been ac- 
customed, as if all that was taking place and 
all that had still to be done in the realm of 
history did not concern him at all. 

Chichag6v, one of the most zealous "cutters- 
off" and "breakers-up," who had first wanted 
to effect a diversion in Greece and then in 
Warsaw but never wished to go where he was 
sent: Chichag6v, noted for the boldness with 
which he spoke to the Emperor, and who con- 
sidered Kutuzov to be under an obligation to 
him because when he was sent to make peace 
with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutu- 
zov, and found that peace had already been 
concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that 



the merit of securing that peace was really 
Kutiizov's; this Chichag6v was the first to meet 
Kutiizov at the castle where the latter was to 
stay. In undress naval uniform, with a dirk, 
and holding his cap under his arm, he handed 
Kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the 
town. The contemptuously respectful attitude 
of the younger men to the old man in his dot- 
age was expressed in the highest degree by the 
behavior of Chichag6v, who knew of the ac- 
cusations that were being directed against 
Kutuzov. 

When speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov in- 
cidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed 
with china that had been captured from him 
at Borfsov had been recovered and would be 
restored to him. 

"You mean to imply that I have nothing to 
eat out of. ... On the contrary, I can supply 
you with everything even if you want to give 
dinner parties," warmly replied Chichagov, 
who tried by every word he spoke to prove 
his own rectitude and therefore imagined 
Kutuzov to be animated by the same de- 
sire. 

Kutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied 
with his subtle penetrating smile: "I meant 
merely to say what I said." 

Contrary to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov 
detained the greater part of the army at Vilna. 
Those about him said that he became extra- 
ordinarily slack and physically feeble during 
his stay in that town. He attended to army 
affairs reluctantly, left everything to his gen- 
erals, and while awaiting the Emperor's arrival 
led a dissipated life. 

Having left Petersburg on the seventh of 
December with his suite Count Tolst6y, 
Prince Volk6nski, Arakchdev, and others the 
Emperor reached Vilna on the eleventh, and 
in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the 
castle. In spite of the severe frost some hun- 
dred generals and staff officers in full parade 
uniform stood in front of the castle, as well 
as a guard of honor of the Semenov regi- 
ment. 

A courier who galloped to the castle in ad- 
vance, in a troyka with three foam-flecked 
horses, shouted "Coming!" and Konovnftsyn 
rushed into the vestibule to inform Kutiizov, 
who was waiting in the hall porter's little 
lodge. 

A minute later the old man's large stout 
figure in full-dress uniform, his chest covered 
with orders and a scarf drawn round his stom- 
ach, waddled out into the porch. He put on 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



629 



his hat with its peaks to the sides and, holding 
his gloves in his hand and walking with an 
effort sideways down the steps to the level of 
the street, took in his hand the report he had 
prepared for the Emperor. 

There was running to and fro and whisper- 
ing; another troyka flew furiously up, and 
then all eyes were turned on an approaching 
sleigh in which the figures of the Emperor and 
Volk6nski could already be descried. 

From the habit of fifty years all this had a 
physically agitating effect on the old general. 
He carefully and hastily felt himself all over, 
readjusted his hat, and pulling himself to- 
gether drew himself up and, at the very mo- 
ment when the Emperor, having alighted from 
the sleigh, lifted his eyes to him, handed him 
the report and began speaking in his smooth, 
ingratiating voice. 

The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned 
Kutiizov from head to foot, frowned for an in- 
stant, but immediately mastering himself 
went up to the old man, extended his arms 
and embraced him. And this embrace too, 
owing to a long-standing impression related 
to his innermost feelings, had its usual effect 
on Kutiizov and he gave a sob. 

The Emperor greeted the officers and the 
Semenov guard, and again pressing the old 
man's hand went with him into the castle. 

When alone with the field marshal the Em- 
peror expressed his dissatisfaction at the slow- 
ness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made 
at Krisnoe and the Berezina, and informed 
him of his intentions for a future campaign 
abroad. Kutiizov made no rejoinder or remark. 
The same submissive, expressionless look with 
which he had listened to the Emperor's com- 
mands on the field of Austerlitz seven years 
before settled on his face now. 

When Kutiizov came out of the study and 
with lowered head was crossing the ballroom 
withrtiis heavy waddling gait, he was arrested 
by someone's voice saying: 

"Your Serene Highness!" 

Kutiizov raised his head and looked for a 
long while into the eyes of Count Tolst6y, 
who stood before him holding a silver salver 
on which lay a small object. Kutiizov seemed 
not to understand what was expected of 
him. 

Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely 
perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face, 
and bowing low and respectfully he took the 
object that lay on the salver. It was the Order 
of St. George of the First Class, 



CHAPTER XI 

NEXT DAY the field marshal gave a dinner and 
ball which the Emperor honored by his pres- 
ence. Kutiizov had received the Order of St. 
George of the First Class and the Emperor 
showed him the highest honors, but everyone 
knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. 
The proprieties were observed and the Emper- 
or was the first to set that example, but every- 
body understood that the old man was blame- 
worthy and good-for-nothing. When Kutiizov, 
conforming to a custom of Catherine's day, 
ordered the standards that had been captured 
to be lowered at the Emperor's feet on his en- 
tering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry 
face and muttered something in which some 
people caught the words, "the old comedian." 
The Emperor's displeasure with Kutiizov 
was specially increased at Vflna by the fact 
that Kutiizov evidently could not or would 
not understand the importance of the coming 
campaign. 

When on the following morning the Em- 
peror said to the officers assembled about him: 
"You have not only saved Russia, you have 
saved Europe!" they all understood that the 
war was not ended. 

Kutiizov alone would not see this and open- 
ly expressed his opinion that no fresh war 
could improve the position or add to the glory 
of Russia, but could only spoil and lower the 
glorious position that Russia had gained. He 
tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibil- 
ity of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hard- 
ships already endured by the people, of the 
possibility of failure and so forth. 

This being the field marshal's frame of mind 
he was naturally regarded as merely a hin- 
drance and obstacle to the impending war. 

To avoid unpleasant encounters with the 
old man, the natural method was to do what 
had been done with him at Austerlitz and with 
Barclay at the beginning of the Russian cam- 
paignto transfer the authority to the Emper- 
or himself, thus cutting the ground from under 
the commander in chief's feet without upset- 
ting the old man by informing him of the 
change. 

With this object his staff was gradually re- 
constructed and its real strength removed 
and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konov- 
nitsyn, and Erm61ov received fresh appoint- 
ments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field 
marshal's great weakness and failing health. 

His health had to be bad for his place to 
be taken away and given to another. And in 



WAR AND PEACE 



fact his health was poor. 

So naturally, simply, and gradually just as 
he had come from Turkey to the Treasury in 
Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to 
the army when he was needed there now 
when his part was played out, Kutuzov's place 
was taken by a new and necessary performer. 

The war of 1812, besides its national signifi- 
cance dear to every Russian heart, was now to 
assume another, a European, significance. 

The movement of peoples from west to east 
was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples 
from east to west, and for this fresh war an- 
other leader was necessary, having qualities 
and views differing from Kutuzov's and ani- 
mated by different motives. 

Alexander I was as necessary for the move- 
ment of the peoples from east to west and for 
the refixing of national frontiers as Kutuzov 
had been for the salvation and glory of Russia. 

Kutuzov did not understand what Europe, 
the balance of power, or Napoleon meant. He 
could not understand it. For the representative 
of the Russian people, after the enemy had 
been destroyed and Russia had been liberated 
and raised to the summit of her glory, there 
was nothing left to do as a Russian. Nothing 
remained for the representative of the na- 
tional war but to die, and Kutuzov died. 

CHAPTER XII 

As GENERALLY HAPPENS, Pierre did not feel the 
full effects of the physical privation and strain 
he had suffered as prisoner until after they 
were over. After his liberation he reached 
Orel, and on the third day there, when pre- 
paring to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid 
up for three months. He had what the doctors 
termed "bilious fever." But despite the fact 
that the doctors treated him, bled him, and 
gave him medicines to drink, he recovered. 

Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre's 
mind by all that happened to him from the 
time of his rescue till his illness. He remem- 
bered only the dull gray weather now rainy 
and now snowy, internal physical distress, and 
pains in his feet and side. He remembered a 
general impression of the misfortunes and 
sufferings of people and of being worried by 
the curiosity of officers and generals who ques- 
tioned him, he also remembered his difficulty 
in procuring a conveyance and horses, and 
above all he remembered his incapacity to 
think and feel all that time. On the day of 
his rescue he had seen the body of Ptya 
Rost6v. That same day he had learned that 



Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of 
Borodin6 for more than a month, had recently 
died in the Rostovs' house at Yaroslavl, and 
Denfsov who told him this news also mentioned 
Heine's death, supposing that Pierre had 
heard of it long before. All this at the time 
seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he 
could not grasp its significance. Just then he 
was only anxious to get away as quickly as 
possible from places where people were killing 
one another, to some peaceful refuge where 
he could recover himself, rest, and think over 
all the strange new facts he had learned; but 
on reaching Orel he immediately fell ill. When 
he came to himself after his illness he saw in 
attendance on him two of his servants, Tere*nty 
and Vska, who had come from Moscow; and 
also his cousin the eldest princess, who had 
been living on his estate at Elects and hearing 
of his rescue and illness had come to look after 
him. 

It was only gradually during his convales- 
cence that Pierre lost the impressions he had 
become accustomed to during the last few 
months and got used to the idea that no one 
would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow, 
that no one would deprive him of his warm 
bed, and that he would be sure to get his din- 
ner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in 
his dreams he still saw himself in the condi- 
tions of captivity. In the same way little by 
little he came to understand the news he had 
been told after his rescue, about the death of 
Prince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the 
destruction of the French. 

A joyous feeling of freedom that complete 
inalienable freedom natural to man which 
he had first experienced at the first halt out- 
side Moscow filled Pierre's soul during his 
convalescence. He was surprised to find that 
this inner freedom, which was independent of 
external conditions, now had as it were an 
additional setting of external liberty. He was 
alone in a strange town, without acquaint- 
ances. No one demanded anything of him or 
sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted: 
the thought of his wife which had been a 
continual torment to him was no longer there, 
since she was no more. 

"Oh, how good! How splendid!" said he to 
himself when a cleanly laid table was moved 
up to him with savory beef tea, or when he 
lay down for the night on a soft clean bed, or 
when he remembered that the French had 
gone and that his wife was no more. "Oh, how 
good, how splendid!" 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



631 



And by old habit he asked himself the 
question: "Well, and what then? What am 
I going to do?" And he immediately gave him- 
self the answer: "Well, I shall live. Ah, how 
splendid!" 

The very question that had formerly tor- 
mented him, the thing he had continually 
sought to find the aim of lifeno longer 
existed for him now. That search for the aim 
of life had not merely disappeared tempo- 
rarilyhe felt that it no longer existed for him 
and could not present itself again. And this 
very absence of an aim gave him the complete, 
joyous sense of freedom which constituted his 
happiness at this time. 

He could not see an aim, for he now had 
faith not faith in any kind of rule, or words, 
or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever- 
manifest God. Formerly he had sought Him 
in aims he set himself. That search for an 
aim had been simply a search for God, and 
suddenly in his captivity he had learned not 
by words or reasoning but by direct feeling 
what his nurse had told him long ago: that 
God is here and everywhere. In his captivity 
he had learned that in Karatdev God was 
greater, more infinite and unfathomable than 
in the Architect of the Universe recognized 
by the Freemasons. He felt like a man who 
after straining his eyes to see into the far dis- 
tance finds what he sought at his very feet. All 
his life he had looked over the heads of the 
men around him, when he should have merely 
looked in front of him without straining his 
eyes. 

In the past he had never been able to find 
that great inscrutable infinite something. He 
had only felt that it must exist somewhere and 
had looked for it. In everything near and com- 
prehensible he had seen only what was limited, 
petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had 
equipped himself with a mental telescope and 
looked into remote space, where petty world- 
liness hiding itself in misty distance had seem- 
ed to him great and infinite merely because it 
was not clearly seen. And such had European 
life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and 
philanthropy seemed to him. But even then, 
at moments of weakness as he had accounted 
them, his mind had penetrated to those dis- 
tances and he had there seen the same petti- 
ness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, how- 
ever, he had learned to see the great, eternal, 
and infinite in everything, and therefore to 
see it and enjoy its contemplation he natu- 
rally threw away the telescope through which 



he had till now gazed over men's heads, and 
gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally 
great, unfathomable, and infinite life around 
him. And the closer he looked the more tran- 
quil and happy he became. That dreadful ques- 
tion, "What for?" which had formerly destroyed 
all his mental edifices, no longer existed for 
him. To that question, "What for?" a simple 
answer was now always ready in his soul: "Be- 
cause there is a God, that God without whose 
will not one hair falls from a man's head." 

CHAPTER XIII 

IN EXTERNAL WAYS Pierre had hardly changed 
at all. In appearance he was just what he used 
to be. As before he was absent-minded and 
seemed occupied not with what was before 
his eyes but with something special of his own. 
The difference between his former and present 
self was that formerly when he did not grasp 
what lay before him or was said to him, he 
had puckered his forehead painfully as if 
vainly seeking to distinguish something at a 
distance. At present he still forgot what was 
said to him and still did not see what was 
before his eyes, but he now looked with a 
scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile 
at what was before him and listened to what 
was said, though evidently seeing and hearing 
something quite different. Formerly he had 
appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy 
man, and so people had been inclined to avoid 
him. Now a smile at the joy of life always 
played round his lips, and sympathy for others 
shone in his eyes with a questioning look as 
to whether they were as contented as he was, 
and people felt pleased by his presence. 

Previously he had talked a great deal, grew 
excited when he talked, and seldom listened; 
now he was seldom carried away in conversa- 
tion and knew how to listen so that people 
readily told him their most intimate secrets. 

The princess, who had never liked Pierre 
and had been particularly hostile to him since 
she had felt herself under obligations to him 
after the old count's death, now after staying 
a short time in Orel where she had come in- 
tending to show Pierre that in spite of his in- 
gratitude she considered it her duty to nurse 
him felt to her surprise and vexation that she 
had become fond of him. Pierre did not in 
any way seek her approval, he merely studied 
her with interest. Formerly she had felt that he 
regarded her with indifference and irony, and 
so had shrunk into herself as she did with 
others and had shown him only the combative 



WAR AND PEACE 



side of her nature; but now he seemed to be 
trying to understand the most intimate places 
of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but 
afterwards gratefully, she let him see the hid- 
den, kindly sides of her character. 

The most cunning man could not have crept 
into her confidence more successfully, evoking 
memories of the best times of her youth and 
showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre's 
cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure 
in drawing out the human qualities of the 
embittered, hard, and (in her own way) proud 
princess. 

"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he 
is not under the influence of bad people but 
of people such as myself," thought she. 

His servants too Ter^nty and Vdska in 
their own way noticed the change that had 
taken place in Pierre. They considered that he 
had become much "simpler." Ter^nty, when 
he had helped him undress and wished him 
good night, often lingered with his master's 
boots in his hands and clothes over his arm, 
to see whether he would not start a talk. And 
Pierre, noticing that Ter^nty wanted a chat, 
generally kept him there. 

"Well, tell me ... now, how did you get 
food?" he would ask. 

And Ter^nty would begin talking of the 
destruction of Moscow, and of the old count, 
and would stand for a long time holding the 
clothes and talking, or sometimes listening to 
Pierre's stories, and then would go out into 
the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with 
his master and affection for him. 

The doctor who attended Pierre and visited 
him every day, though he considered it his 
duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every 
moment was of value to suffering humanity, 
would sit for hours with Pierre telling him his 
favorite anecdotes and his observations on the 
characters of his patients in general, and 
especially of the ladies. 

"It's a pleasure to talk to a man like that; 
he is not like our provincials," he would 
say. 

There were several prisoners from the 
French army in Orel, and the doctor brought 
one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre. 

This officer began visiting Pierre, and the 
princess used to make fun of the tenderness 
the Italian expressed for him. 

The Italian seemed happy only when he 
could come to see Pierre, talk with him, tell 
him about his past, his life at home, and his 
love, and pour out to him his indignation 



against the French and especially against Na- 
poleon. 

"If all Russians are in the least like you, it 
is sacrilege to fight such a nation," he said to 
Pierre. "You, who have suffered so from the 
French, do not even feel animosity toward 
them." 

Pierre had evoked the passionate affection 
of the Italian merely by evoking the best side 
of his nature and taking a pleasure in so do- 
ing. 

During the last days of Pierre's stay in Orel 
his old Masonic acqaintance Count Willarski, 
who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807, 
came to see him. Willarski was married to a 
Russian heiress who had a large estate in Orel 
province, and he occupied a temporary post 
in the commissariat department in that town. 

Hearing that Beziikhov was in Orel, Will- 
arski, though they had never been intimate, 
came to him with the professions of friendship 
and intimacy that people who meet in a desert 
generally express for one another. Willarski 
felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a 
man of his own circle and, as he supposed, of 
similar interests. 

But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed 
that Pierre had lagged much behind the times, 
and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, 
into apathy and egotism. 

"You are letting yourself go, my dear fel- 
low," he said. 

But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter 
now than it had been formerly to be with 
Pierre, and came to see him every day. To 
Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willar- 
ski, it seemed strange to think that he had been 
like that himself but a short time before. 

Willarski was a married man with a family, 
busy with his family affairs, his wife's affairs, 
and his official duties. He regarded all these 
occupations as hindrances to life, and consid- 
ered that they were all contemptible because 
their aim was the welfare of himself and his 
family. Military, administrative, political, and 
Masonic interests continually absorbed his 
attention. And Pierre, without trying to change 
the other's views and without condemning 
him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused 
smile now habitual to him, was interested in 
this strange though very familiar phenomenon. 

There was a new feature in Pierre's rela- 
tions with Willarski, with the princess, with 
the doctor, and with all the people he now 
met, which gained for him the general good 
will. This was his acknowledgment of the im- 



BOOK FIFTEEN 

possibility of changing a man's convictions by 
words, and his recognition of the possibility 
of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing 
things each from his own point of view. This 
legitimate peculiarity of. each individual which 
used to excite and irritate Pierre now became 
a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the 
interest he took in, other people. The differ- 
ence, and sometimes complete contradiction, 
between men's opinions and their lives, and be- 
tween one man and another, pleased him and 
drew from him an amused and gentle smile. 

In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt 
within himself a center of gravity he had pre- 
viously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary ques- 
tions, especially requests for money to which, 
as an extremely wealthy man, he was very fre- 
quently exposed, produced in him a state of 
hopeless agitation and perplexity. "To give or 
not to give?" he had asked himself. "I have it 
and he needs it. But someone else needs it still 
more. Who needs it most? And perhaps they 
are both impostors?" In the old days he had 
been unable to find a way out of all these sur- 
mises and had given to all who asked as long 
as he had anything to give. Formerly he had 
been in a similar state of perplexity with re- 
gard to every question concerning his property, 
when one person advised one thing and an- 
other something else. 

Now to his surprise he found that he no 
longer felt either doubt or perplexity about 
these questions. There was now within him 
a judge who by some rule unknown to him 
decided what should or should not be done. 

He was as indifferent as heretofore to money 
matters, but now he felt certain of what ought 
and what ought not to be done. The first time 
he had recourse to his new judge was when a 
French prisoner, a colonel, came to him and, 
after talking a great deal about his exploits, 
concluded by making what amounted to a 
demand that Pierre should give him four 
thousand francs to send to his wife and chil- 
dren. Pierre refused without the least difficulty 
or effort, and was afterwards surprised how 
simple and easy had been what used to ap- 
pear so insurmountably difficult. At the same 
time that he refused the colonel's demand he 
made up his mind that he must have recourse 
to artifice when leaving Orel, to induce the 
Italian officer to accept some money of which 
he was evidently in need. A further proof to 
Pierre of his own more settled outlook on 
practical matters was furnished by his decision 
with regard to his wife's debts and to the re- 



633 



building of his houses in and near Moscow. 

His head steward came to him at Orel and 
Pierre reckoned up with him his diminished 
income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, 
according to the head steward's calculation, 
about two million rubles. 

To console Pierre for these losses the head 
steward gave him an estimate showing that 
despite these losses his income would not be 
diminished but would even be increased if he 
refused to pay his wife's debts which he was 
under no obligation to meet, and did not re- 
build his Moscow house and the country house 
on his Moscow estate, which had cost him 
eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in 
nothing. 

"Yes, of course that's true," said Pierre with 
a cheerful smile. "I don't need all that at all. 
By being ruined I have become much richer." 

But in January Sav^lich came from Moscow 
and gave him an account of the state of things 
there, and spoke of the estimate an architect 
had made of the cost of rebuilding the town 
and country houses, speaking of this as of a set- 
tled matter. About the same time he received 
letters from Prince Vasili and other Peters- 
burg acquaintancesspeakingof his wife'sdebts. 
And Pierre decided that the steward's pro- 
posals which had so pleased him were wrong 
and that he must go to Petersburg and settle 
his wife's affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. 
Why this was necessary he did not know, but 
he knew for certain that it was necessary. His 
income would be reduced by three fourths, 
but he felt it must be done. 

Willarski was going to Moscow and they 
agreed to travel together. 

During the whole time of his convalescence 
in Orel Pierre had experienced a feeling of 
joy, freedom, and life; but when during his 
journey he found himself in the open world 
and saw hundreds of new faces, that feeling 
was intensified. Throughout his journey he 
felt like a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone 
the stagecoach driver, the post-house overseers, 
the peasants on the roads and in the villages- 
had a new significance for him. The presence 
and remarks of Willarski who continually de- 
plored the ignorance and poverty of Russia 
and its backwardness compared with Europe 
only heightened Pierre's pleasure. Where Will- 
arski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary 
strength and vitality the strength which in 
that vast space amid the snows maintained the 
life of this original, peculiar, and unique peo- 
ple. He did not contradict Willarski and even

sions that could lead to nothingand he 
smiled joyfully as he listened to him. 

CHAPTER XIV 

IT WOULD BE difficult to explain why and whither 
ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurry- 
ing: some from the heap dragging bits of rub- 
bish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the 
heap, or why they jostle, overtake one another, 
and fight, and it would be equally difficult to 
explain what caused the Russians after the 
departure of the French to throng to the place 
that had formerly been Moscow. But when we 
watch the ants round their ruined heap, the 
tenacity, energy, and immense number of the 
delving insects prove that despite the destruc- 
tion of the heap, something indestructible, 
which though intangible is the real strength of 
the colony, still exists; and similarly, though 
in Moscow in the month of October there was 
no government and no churches, shrines, riches, 
or housesit was still the Moscow it had been 
in August. All was destroyed, except something 
intangible yet powerful and indestructible. 

The motives of those who thronged from all 
sides to Moscow after it had been cleared of 
the enemy were most diverse and personal, 
and at first for the most part savage and brutal. 
One motive only they all had in common: a 
desire to get to the place that had been called 
Moscow, to apply their activities there. 

Within a week Moscow already had fifteen 
thousand inhabitants, in a fortnight twenty- 
five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 
1813 the number, ever increasing and increas- 
ing, exceeded what it had been in 1812. 

The first Russians to enter Moscow were 
the Cossacks of Wint/ingerode's detachment, 
peasants from the adjacent villages, and resi- 
dents who had fled from Moscow and had been 
hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who en- 
tered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered 
it in their turn. They continued what the 
French had begun. Trains of peasant carts 
came to Moscow to carry off to the villages 
what had been abandoned in the ruined 
houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried 
off what they could to their camps, and the 
householders seized all they could find in other 
houses and moved it to their own, pretending 
that it was their property. 

But the first plunderers were followed by a 
second and a third contingent, and with in- 
creasing numbers plundering became more 



The French found Moscow abandoned but 
with all the organizations of regular life, with 
diverse branches of commerce and craftsman- 
ship, with luxury, and governmental and re- 
ligious institutions. These forms were lifeless 
but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, 
warehouses, market stalls, granaries for the 
most part still stocked with goods and there 
were factories and workshops, palaces and 
wealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, 
prisons, government offices, churches, and 
cathedrals. The longer the French remained 
the more these forms of town life perished, 
until finally all was merged into one confused, 
lifeless scene of plunder. 

The more the plundering by the French con- 
tinued, the more both the wealth of Moscow 
and the strength of its plunderers was de- 
stroyed. But plundering by the Russians, with 
which the reoccupation of the city began, had 
an opposite effect: the longer it continued and 
the greater the number of people taking part 
in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the 
city and its regular life restored. 

Besides the plunderers, very various people, 
some drawn by curiosity, some by official duties, 
some by self-interesthouse owners, clergy, 
officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and 
peasants streamed in to Moscow as blood flows 
to the heart. 

Within a week the peasants who came with 
empty carts to carry off plunder were stopped 
by the authorities and made to cart the corpses 
out of the town. Other peasants, having heard 
of their comrades' discomfiture, came to town 
bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down 
one another's prices to below what they had 
been in former days. Gangs of carpenters hop- 
ing for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, 
and on all sides logs were being hewn, new 
houses built, and old, charred ones repaired. 
Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cook- 
shops and taverns were opened in partially 
burned houses. The clergy resumed the serv- 
ices in many churches that had not been burn- 
ed. Donors contributed Church property that 
had been stolen. Government clerks set up 
their baize-covered tables and their pigeon- 
holes of documents in small rooms. The higher 
authorities and the police organized the dis- 
tribution of goods left behind by the French. 
The owners of houses in which much property 
had been left, brought there from other houses, 
complained of the injustice of taking every- 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



635 



thing to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin; 
others insisted that as the French had gathered 
things from different houses into this or that 
house, it would be unfair to allow its owner 
to keep all that was found there. They abused 
the police and bribed them, made out esti- 
mates at ten times their value for government 
stores that had perished in the fire, and de- 
manded relief. And Count Rostopchin wrote 
proclamations. 

CHAPTER XV 

AT THE END of January Pierre went to Moscow 
and stayed in an annex of his house which had 
not been burned. He called on Count Ros- 
topchfn and on some acquaintances who were 
back in Moscow, and he intended to leave for 
Petersburg two days later. Everybody was cele- 
brating the victory, everything was bubbling 
with life in the ruined but reviving city. Every- 
one was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished 
to meet him, and everyone questioned him 
about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly 
well disposed toward them all, but was now 
instinctively on his guard for fear of binding 
himself in any way. To all questions put to 
himwhether important or quite trifling such 
as: Where would he live? Was he going to re- 
build? When was he going to Petersburg and 
would he mind taking a parcel for someone? 
he replied: "Yes, perhaps," or, "I think so," 
and so on. 

He had heard that the Rost6vs were at Kos- 
tromd but the thought of Natasha seldom 
occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleas- 
ant memory of the distant past. He felt him- 
self not only free from social obligations but 
also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, 
he had aroused in himself. 

On the third day after his arrival he heard 
from the Drubetsk6ys that Princess Mary was 
in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days 
of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's 
thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh 
vividness. Having heard at dinner that Prin- 
cess Mary was in Moscow and living in her 
house which had not been burned in Voz- 
dvizhenka Street, he drove that same evening 
to see her. 

On his way to the house Pierre kept think- 
ing of Prince Andrew, of their friendship, of 
his various meetings with him, and especially 
of the last one at Borodin6. 

"Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame 
of mind he was then in? Is it possible that the 
meaning of life was not disclosed to him be- 



fore he died?" thought Pierre. He recalled 
Karataev and his death and involuntarily be- 
gan to compare these two men, so different, 
and yet so similar in that they had both lived 
and both died and in the love he felt for both 
of them. 

Pierre drove up to the house of the old 
prince in a most serious mood. The house had 
escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but 
its general aspect was unchanged. The old foot- 
man, who met Pierre with a stern face as if 
wishing to make the visitor feel that the ab- 
sence of the old prince had not disturbed the 
order of things in the house, informed him 
that the princess had gone to her own apart- 
ments, and that she received on Sundays. 

"Announce me. Perhaps she will see me," 
said Pierre. 

"Yes, sir," said the man. "Please step into 
the portrait gallery." 

A few minutes later the footman returned 
with Dessalles, who brought word from the 
princess that she would be very glad to see 
Pierre if he would excuse her want of cere- 
mony and come upstairs to her apartment. 

In a rather low room lit by one candle sat 
the princess and with her another person 
dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the 
princess always had lady companions, but who 
they were and what they were like he never 
knew or remembered. "This must be one of 
her companions," he thought, glancing at the 
lady in the black dress. 

The princess rose quickly to meet him and 
held out her hand. 

"Yes," she said, looking at his altered face 
after he had kissed her hand, "so this is how we 
meet again. He often spoke of you even at the 
very last," she went on, turning her eyes from 
Pierre to her companion with a shyness that 
surprised him for an instant. 

"I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was 
the first piece of good news we had received 
for a long time." 

Again the princess glanced round at her 
companion with even more uneasiness in her 
manner and was about to add something, but 
Pierre interrupted her. 

"Just imagine I knew nothing about him!" 
said he. "I thought he had been killed. All I 
know I heard at second hand from others. I 
only know that he fell in with the Rost6vs. 
. . . What a strange coincidence 1" 

Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He 
glanced once at the companion's face, saw her 
attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and, 



636 



WAR AND PEACE 



as often happens when one is talking, felt 
somehow that this companion in the black 
dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who 
would not hinder his conversing freely with 
Princess Mary. 

But when he mentioned the Rost6vs, Prin- 
cess Mary's face expressed still greater embar- 
rassment. She again glanced rapidly from 
Pierre's face to that of the lady in the black 
dress and saidT 

"Do you really not recognize her?" 

Pierre looked again at the companion's pale, 
delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar 
mouth, and something near to him, long for- 
gotten and more than sweet, looked at him 
from those attentive eyes. 

"But no, it can't be!" he thought. "This 
stern, thin, pale face that looks so much older! 
It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her." 
But at that moment Princess Mary said, "Natd- 
sha!" And with difficulty, effort, and stress, like 
the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges, 
a smile appeared on the face with the atten- 
tive eyes, and from that opening door came a 
breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with 
a happiness he had long forgotten and of which 
he had not even been thinking especially at 
that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and 
enveloped him completely. When she smiled 
doubt was no longer possible, it was Natasha 
and he loved her. 

At that moment Pierre involuntarily be- 
trayed to her, to Princess Mary, and above all 
to himself, a secret of which he himself had 
been unaware. He flushed joyfully yet with 
painful distress. He tried to hide his agitation. 
But the more he tried to hide it the more 
clearly clearer than any words could have 
donedid he betray to himself, to her, and to 
Princess Mary that he loved her. 

"No, it's only the unexpectedness of it," 
thought Pierre. But as soon as he tried to con- 
tinue the conversation he had begun with 
Princess Mary he again glanced at Natasha, 
and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and 
a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and 
fear seized his soul. He became confused in his 
speech and stopped in the middle of what he 
was saying. 

Pierre had failed to notice Natasha because 
he did not at all expect to see her there, but he 
had failed to recognize her because the change 
in her since he last saw her was immense. She 
had grown thin and pale, but that was not 
what made her unrecognizable; she was un- 
recognizable at the moment he entered because 



on that face whose eyes had always shone with 
a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when 
he first entered and glanced at her there was 
not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes 
were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative. 
Pierre's confusion was not reflected by any 
confusion on Natdsha's part, but only by the 
pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole 
face. 

CHAPTER XVI 

"SHE HAS COME to stay with me," said Princess 
Mary. "The count and countess will be here 
in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful 
state; but it was necessary for Natasha herself 
to see a doctor. They insisted on her coming 
with me." 

"Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?" 
said Pierre, addressing Natdsha. "You know 
it happened the very day we were rescued. I 
saw him. What a delightful boy he was!" 

Natdsha looked at him, and by way of an- 
swer to his words her eyes widened and lit up. 

"What can one say or think of as a consola- 
tion?" said Pierre. "Nothing! Why had such a 
splendid boy, so full of life, to die?" 

"Y^s, in these days it would be hard to live 
without faith . . ." remarked Princess Mary. 

"Yes, yes, that is really true," Pierre hastily 
interrupted her. 

"Why is it true?" Natdsha asked, looking at- 
tentively into Pierre's eyes. 

"How can you ask why?" said Princess Mary. 
"The thought alone of what awaits . . ." 

Natdsha without waiting for Princess Mary 
to finish again looked inquiringly at Pierre. 

"And because," Pierre continued, "only one 
who believes that there is a God ruling us can 
bear a loss such as hers and . . . yours." 

Natdsha had already opened her mouth to 
speak but suddenly stopped. Pierre hurriedly 
turned away from her and again addressed 
Princess Mary, asking about his friend's last 
days. 

Pierre's confusion had now almost vanished, 
but at the same time he felt that his freedom 
had also completely gone. He felt that there 
was now a judge of his every word and action 
whose judgment mattered more to him than 
that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke 
now he was considering what impression his 
words would make on Natdsha. He did not 
purposely say things to please her, but what- 
ever he was saying he regarded from her stand- 
point. 

Princess Mary reluctantly as is usual in such 



BOOK FIFTEEN 

cases began telling of the condition in which 
she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierre's 
face quivering with emotion, his questions and 
his eager restless expression, gradually com- 
pelled her to go into details which she feared 
to recall for her own sake. 

"Yes, yes, and so ... ?" Pierre kept saying 
as he leaned toward her with his whole body 
and eagerly listened to her story. "Yes, yes ... 
so he grew tranquil and softened? With all his 
soul he had always sought one thing to be 
perfectly good so he could not be afraid of 
death. The faults he had if he had any were 
not of his making. So he did soften? . . . What 
a happy thing that he saw you again," he added, 
suddenly turning to Natasha and looking at 
her with eyes full of tears. 

Natasha's face twitched. She frowned and 
lowered her eyes for a moment. She hesitated 
for an instant whether to speak or not. 

"Yes, that was happiness," she then said in 
her quiet voice with its deep chest notes. "For 
me it certainly was happiness." She paused. 
"And he ... he ... he said he was wishing for 
it at the very moment I entered the room. . . ." 

Natdsha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed 
her clasped hands on her knees, and then con- 
trolling herself with an evident effort lifted 
her head and began to speak rapidly. 

"We knew nothing of it when we started 
from Moscow. I did not dare to ask about him. 
Then suddenly S6nya told me he was traveling 
with us. I had no idea and could not imagine 
what state he was in, all I wanted was to see 
him and be with him," she said, trembling, 
and breathing quickly. 

And not letting them interrupt her she went 
on to tell what she had never yet mentioned 
to anyone all she had lived through during 
those three weeks of their journey and life at 
Yarosldvl. 

Pierre listened to her with lips parted and 
eyes fixed upon her full of tears. As he listened 
he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of 
death, nor of what she was telling. He listened 
to her and felt only pity for her, for what she 
was suffering now while she was speaking. 

Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to 
hold back her tears, sat beside Natdsha, and 
heard for the first time the story of those last 
days of her brother's and Natdsha's love. 

Evidently Natdsha needed to tell that pain- 
ful yet joyful tale. 

She spoke, mingling most trifling details 
with the intimate secrets of her soul, and it 
seemed as if she could never finish. Several 



637 
times she repeated the same thing twice. 

Dessalles' voice was heard outside the door 
asking whether little Nicholas might come in 
to say good night. 

"Well, that's all everything," said Natdsha. 

She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, 
almost ran to the door which was hidden by 
curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed 
from the room with a moan either of pain or 
sorrow. 

Pierre gazed at the door through which she 
had disappeared and did not understand why 
he suddenly felt-all alone in the world. 

Princess Mary roused him from his abstrac- 
tion by drawing his attentioa to her nephew 
who had entered the room. 

At that moment of emotional tenderness 
young Nicholas' face, which resembled his 
father's, affected Pierre so much that when he 
had kissed the boy he got up quickly, took out 
his handkerchief, and went to the window. He 
wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she 
would not let him go. 

"No, Natdsha and I sometimes don't go to 
sleep till after two, so please don't go. I will 
order supper. Go downstairs, we will come im- 
mediately." 

Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary 
told him: "This is the first time she has talked 
of him like that." 



CHAPTER XVII 

PIERRE WAS SHOWN into the large, brightly lit 
dining room; a few minutes later he heard 
footsteps and Princess Mary entered with 
Natdsha. Natdsha was calm, though a severe 
and grave expression had again settled on her 
face. They all three of them now experienced 
that feeling of awkwardness which usually fol- 
lows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is im- 
possible to go back to the same conversation, to 
talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire 
to speak is there and silence seems like affecta- 
tion. They went silently to table. The foot- 
men drew back the chairs and pushed them up 
again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin 
and, resolving to break the silence, looked at 
Natdsha and at Princess Mary. They had evi- 
dently both formed the same resolution; the 
eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a con- 
fession that besides sorrow life also has joy. 

"Do you take vodka, Count?" asked Princess 
Mary, and those words suddenly banished the 
shadows of the past, "Now tell us about your- 
self," said she. "One hears such improbable 
wonders about you/' 



638 



WAR AND PEACE 



"Yes," replied Pierre with the smile of mild 
irony now habitual to him. "They even tell 
me wonders I myself never dreamed of 1 Mary 
Abrdmovna invited me to her house and kept 
telling me what had happened, or ought to 
have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych also 
instructed me how I ought to tell of my expe- 
riences. In general I have noticed that it is 
very easy to be an interesting man (I am an in- 
teresting man now); people invite me out and 
tell me all about myself." 

Natasha smiled and was on the point of 
speaking. 

"We have been told," Princess Mary inter- 
rupted her, "that you lost two millions in 
Moscow. Is that true?" 

"But I am three times as rich as before,'* re- 
turned Pierre. 

Though the position was now altered by his 
decision to pay his wife's debts and to rebuild 
his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had 
become three times as rich as before. 

"What I have certainly gained is freedom," 
he began seriously, but did not continue, no- 
ticing that this theme was too egotistic. 

"And are you building?" 

"Yes. Savelich says I must!" 

"Tell me, you did not know of the countess' 
death when you decided to remain in Mos- 
cow?" asked Princess Mary and immediately 
blushed, noticing that her question, following 
his mention of freedom, ascribed to his words 
a meaning he had perhaps not intended. 

"No," answered Pierre, evidently not con- 
sidering awkward the meaning Princess Mary 
had given to his words. "I heard of it in Orel 
and you cannot imagine how it shocked me. 
We were not an exemplary couple," he added 
quickly, glancing at Natdsha and noticing on 
her face curiosity as to how he would speak of 
his wife, "but her death shocked me terribly. 
When two people quarrel they are always both 
in fault, and one's own guilt suddenly becomes 
terribly serious when the other is no longer 
alive. And then such a death . . . without friends 
and without consolation! I am very, very sorry 
for her," he concluded, and was pleased to no- 
tice a look of glad approval on Natasha's face. 

"Yes, and so you are once more an eligible 
bachelor," said Princess Mary. 

Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a 
long time tried not to look at Natdsha. When 
he ventured to glance her way again her face 
was cold, stern, and he fancied even con- 
temptuous. 

"And did you really see and speak to Na- 



poleon, as we have been told?" said Princess 
Mary. 

Pierre laughed. 

"No, not oncel Everybody seems to imagine 
that being taken prisoner means being Napo- 
leon's guest. Not only did I never see him but 
I heard nothing about himI was in much 
lower company!" 

Supper was over, and Pierre who at first de- 
clined to speak about his captivity was gradu- 
ally led on to do so. 

"But it's true that you remained in Moscow 
to kill Napoleon?" Natdsha asked with a slight 
smile. "I guessed it then when we met at the 
Sukharev tower, do you remember?" 

Pierre admitted that it was true, and from 
that was gradually led by Princess Mary's ques- 
tions and especially by Natasha's into giving 
a detailed account of his adventures. 

At first he spoke with the amused and mild 
irony now customary with him toward every- 
body and especially toward himself, but when 
he came to describe the horrors and sufferings 
he had witnessed he was unconsciously car- 
ried away and began speaking with the sup- 
pressed emotion of a man re-experiencing in 
recollection strong impressions he has lived 
through. 

Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked 
now at Pierre and now at Natasha. In the 
whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his 
goodness. Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the 
expression of her face constantly changing 
with the narrative, watched Pierre with an 
attention that never wanderedevidently her- 
self experiencing all that he described. Not 
only her look, but her exclamations and the 
brief questions she put, showed Pierre that she 
understood just what he wished to convey. It 
was clear that she understood not only what 
he said but also what he wished to, but could 
not, express in words. The account Pierre 
gave of the incident with the child and the 
woman for protecting whom he was arrested 
was this: "It was an awful sight children aban- 
doned, some in the flames . . . One was snatched 
out before my eyes . . . and there were women 
who had their things snatched off and their 
earrings torn out . . ." he flushed and grew con- 
fused. "Then a patrol arrived and all the men 
all those who were not looting, that is were 
arrested, and I among them." 

"I am sure you're not telling us everything; 
I am sure you did something . . ." said Natdsha, 
and pausing added, "something fine?" 

Pierre continued. When he spoke of the exe- 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



639 



cution he wanted to pass over the horrible de- 
tails, but Natasha insisted that he should not 
omit anything. 

Pierre began to tell about Karatdev, but 
paused. By this time he had risen from the ta- 
ble and was pacing the room, Natasha follow- 
ing him with her eyes. Then he added: 

"No, you can't understand what I learned 
from that illiterate manthat simple fellow." 

"Yes, yes, go onl" said Natdsha. "Where is 
he?" 

"They killed him almost before my eyes." 

And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, 
went on to tell of the last days of their retreat, 
of Karatdev's illness and his death. 

He told of his adventures as he had never 
yet recalled them. He now, as it were, saw a 
new meaning in all he had gone through. Now 
that he was telling it all to Natdsha he experi- 
enced that pleasure which a man has when 
women listen to himnot clever women who 
when listening either try to remember what 
they hear to enrich their minds and when op- 
portunity offers to retell it, or who wish to 
adopt it to some thought of their own and 
promptly contribute their own clever com- 
ments prepared in their own little mental work- 
shop but the pleasure given by real women 
gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the 
very best a man shows of himself. Natasha with- 
out knowing it was all attention: she did not 
lose a word, no single quiver in Pierre's voice, 
no look, no twitch of a muscle in his face, nor 
a single gesture. She caught the unfinished 
word in its flight and took it straight into her 
open heart, divining the secret meaning of all 
Pierre's mental travail. 

Princess Mary understood his story and sym- 
pathized with him, but she now saw something 
else that absorbed all her attention. She saw 
the possibility of love and happiness between 
Natasha and Pierre, and the first thought of 
this filled her heart with gladness. 

It was three o'clock in the morning. The 
footmen came in with sad and stern faces to 
change the candles, but no one noticed them. 

Pierre finished his story. Natasha continued 
to look at him intently with bright, attentive, 
and animated eyes, as if trying to understand 
something more which he had perhaps left un- 
told. Pierre in shamefaced and happy confu- 
sion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to 
think what to say next to introduce a fresh 
subject. Princess Mary was silent. It occurred 
to none of them that it was three o'clock and 
time to go to bed. 



"People speak of misfortunes and suffer- 
ings," remarked Pierre, "but if at this moment 
I were asked: 'Would you rather be what you 
were before you were taken prisoner, or go 
through all this again?' then for heaven's sake 
let me again have captivity and horsefleshl 
We imagine that when we are thrown out of 
our usual ruts all is lost, but it is only then that 
what is new and good begins. While there is 
life there is happiness. There is much, much 
before us. I say this to you," he added, turning 
to Natdsha. 

"Yes, yes," she said, answering something 
quite different. "I too should wish nothing but 
to relive it all from the beginning." 

Pierre looked intently at her. 

"Yes, and nothing more," said Natdsha. 

"It's not true, not true!" cried Pierre. "I am 
not to blame for beingalive and wishing to live 
nor you either." 

Suddenly Natasha bent her head, covered 
her face with her hands, and began to cry. 

"What is it, Natdsha?" said Princess Mary. 

"Nothing, nothing." She smiled at Pierre 
through her tears. "Good night! It is time for 
bed." 

Pierre rose and took his leave. 

Princess Mary and Natdsha met as usual in 
the bedroom. They talked of what Pierre had 
told them. Princess Mary did not express her 
opinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of 
him. 

"Well, good night, Mary!' 1 said Natasha. 
"Do you know, I am often afraid that by not 
speaking of him" (she meant Prince Andrew) 
"for fear of not doing justice to our feelings, 
we forget him." 

Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby ac- 
knowledged the justice of Natasha's remark, 
but she did not express agreement in words. 

"Is it possible to forget?" said she. 

"It did me so much good to tell all about it 
today. It was hard and painful, but good, very 
good!" said Natdsha. "I am sure he really loved 
him. That is why I told him . . . Was it all 
right?" she added, suddenly blushing. 

"To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid 
man he is!" said Princess Mary. 

"Do you know, Mary . . ." Natdsha suddenly 
said with a mischievous smile such as Princess 
Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, 
"he has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and 
freshas if he had just come out of a Russian 
bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. 
Isn't it true?"

"Yes," replied Princess Mary. "He has great- 
ly improved." 

"With a short coat and his hair cropped; 
just as if, well, just as if he had come straight 
from the bath . . . Papa used to ..." 

"I understand why he" (Prince Andrew) 
"liked no one so much as him," said Princess 
Mary. 

"Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say 
men are friends when they are quite different. 
That must be true. Really he is quite unlike 
him in everything." 

"Yes, but he's wonderful." 

"Well, good night," said Natdsha. 

And the same mischievous smile lingered 
for a long time on her face as if it had been 
forgotten there. 

CHAPTER XVIII 

IT WAS A LONG TIME before Pierre could fall 
asleep that night. He paced up and down his 
room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult 
problem and frowning, now suddenly shrug- 
ging his shoulders and wincing, and now smil- 
ing happily. 

He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Nata- 
sha, and of their love, at one moment jealous 
of her past, then reproaching himself for that 
feeling. It was already six in the morning and 
he still paced up and down the room. 

"Well, what's to be done if it cannot be 
avoided? What's to be done? Evidently it has 
to be so," said he to himself, and hastily un- 
dressing he got into bed, happy and agitated 
but free from hesitation or indecision. 

"Strange and impossible as such happiness 
seems, I must do everything that she and 1 
may be man and wife," he told himself. 

A few days previously Pierre had decided to 
go to Petersburg on the Friday. When he awoke 
on the Thursday, Savlich came to ask him 
about packing for the journey. 

"What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? 
Who is therein Petersburg?" he asked involun- 
tarily, though only to himself. "Oh, yes, long 
ago before this happened I did for some reason 
mean to go to Petersburg," he reflected. "Why? 
But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is 
and how attentive, and how he remembers 
everything," he thought, looking at Sav^lich's 
old face, "and what a pleasant smile he has!" 

"Well, Sav&amp;ich, do you still not wish to ac- 
cept your freedom?" Pierre asked him. 

"What's the good of freedom to me, your 
excellency? We lived under the late count the 
kingdom of heaven be his! and we have lived 



under you too, without ever being wronged." 

"And your children?" 

"The children will live just the same. With 
such masters one can live." 

"But what about my heirs?" said Pierre. 
"Supposing I suddenly marry ... it might hap- 
pen," he added with an involuntary smile. 

"If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it 
would be a good thing." 

"How easy he thinks it," thought Pierre. "He 
doesn't know how terrible it is and how dan- 
gerous. Too soon or too late ... it is terrible!" 

"So what are your orders? Are you starting 
tomorrow?" asked Save*lich. 

"No, I'll put it off for a bit. I'll tell you later. 
You must forgive the trouble I have put you 
to," said Pierre, and seeing Save*lich smile, he 
thought: "But how strange it is that he should 
not know that now there is no Petersburg for 
me, and that that must be settled first of all! 
But probably he knows it well enough and is 
only pretending. Shall I have a talk with him 
and see what he thinks?" Pierre reflected. "No, 
another time." 

At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his 
cousin, that he had been to see Princess Mary 
the day before and had there met "Whom do 
you think? Natasha Rost6va!" 

The princess seemed to see nothing more 
extraordinary in that than if he had seen Anna 
Semenovna. 

"Do you know her?" asked Pierre. 

"I have seen the princess," she replied. "I 
heard that they were arranging a match for 
her with young Rost6v. It would be a very 
good thing for the Rost6vs, they are said to 
be utterly ruined." 

"No; I mean doyouknowNatdsha Rost6va?" 

"1 heard about that affair of hers at the time. 
It was a great pity." 

"No, she either doesn't understand or is pre- 
tending," thought Pierre. "Better not say any- 
thing to her either." 

The princess too had prepared provisions 
for Pierre's journey. 

"How kind they all are," thought Pierre. 
"What is surprising is that they should trouble 
about these things now when it can no longer 
be of interest to them. And all for me!" 

On the same day the Chief of Police came 
to Pierre, inviting him to send a representative 
to the Faceted Palace to recover things that 
were to be returned to their owners that day. 

"And this man too," thought Pierre, looking 
into the face of the Chief of Police. "What a 
fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy 



BOOK FIFTEEN 

bothering about such trifles now\ And they 
actually say he is not honest and takes bribes. 
What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn't he take 
bribes? That's the way he was brought up, and 
everybody does it. But what a kind, pleasant 
face and how he smiles as he looks at me." 

Pierre went to Princess Mary's to dinner. 

As he drove through the streets past the 
houses that had been burned down, he was 
surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The 
picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tum- 
ble-down walls of the burned-out quarters of 
the town, stretching out and concealing one 
another, reminded him of the Rhine and the 
Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their pas- 
sengers, the carpenters cutting the timber for 
new houses with their axes, the women hawk- 
ers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with 
cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say: "Ah, 
there he is! Let's see what will come of it!" 

At the entrance to Princess Mary's house 
Pierre felt doubtful whether he had really 
been there the night before and had really seen 
Natdsha and talked to her. "Perhaps I imagined 
it; perhaps I shall go in and find no one there." 
But he had hardly entered the room before he 
felt her presence with his whole being by the 
loss of his sense of freedom. She was in the 
same black dress with soft folds and her hair 
was done the same way as the day before, yet 
she was quite different. Had she been like this 
when he entered the day before he could not 
for a moment have failed to recognize her. 

She was as he had known her almost as a 
child and later on as Prince Andrew's fiancee. 
A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, 
and on her face was a friendly and strangely 
roguish expression. 

Pierre dined with them and would have 
spent the whole evening there, but Princess 
Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the 
house with her. 

Next day he came early, dined, and stayed 
the whole evening. Though Princess Mary and 
Natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor 
and though all Pierre's interest was now cen- 
tered in that house, by the evening they had 
talked over everything and the conversation 
passed from one trivial topic to another and 
repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long that 
Princess Mary and Natdsha exchanged glances, 
evidently wondering when he would go. Pierre 
noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy 
and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply 
could not get up and take his leave. 

Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, 



641 

rose first, and complaining of a headache be- 
gan to say good night. 

"So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?" 
she asked. 

"No, I am not going," Pierre replied hastily, 
in a surprised tone and as though offended. 
"Yes ... no ... to Petersburg? Tomorrow 
but I won't say good-by yet. I will call round 
in case you have any commissions for me," 
said he, standing before Princess Mary and 
turning red, but not taking his departure. 

Natasha gave him her hand and went out. 
Princess Mary on the other hand instead of go- 
ing away sank into an armchair, and looked 
sternly and intently at him with her deep, ra- 
diant eyes. The weariness she had plainly 
shown before had now quite passed off. With a 
deep and long-drawn sigh she seemed to be pre- 
pared for a lengthy talk. 

When Natdsha left the room Pierre's confu- 
sion and awkwardness immediately vanished 
and were replaced by eager excitement. He 
quickly moved an armchair toward Princess 
Mary. 

"Yes, I wanted to tell you," said he, answer- 
ing her look as if she had spoken. "Princess, 
help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Prin- 
cess, my dear friend, listenl I know it all. I 
know I am not worthy of her, I know it's im- 
possible to speak of it now. But I want to be a 
brother to her. No, not that, I don't, I can't . . ." 

He paused and rubbed his face and eyes 
with his hands. 

"Well," he went on with an evident effort 
at self-control and coherence. "I don't know 
when I began to love her, but I have loved her 
and her alone all my life, and I love her so that 
I cannot imagine life without her. I cannot 
propose to her at present, but the thought that 
perhaps she might someday be my wife and 
that I may be missing that possibility . . . that 
possibility ... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope? 
Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!" he 
added after a pause, and touched her hand as 
she did not reply. 

"I am thinking of what you have told me," 
answered Princess Mary. "This is what I will 
say. You are right that to speak to her of love 
at present . . ." 

Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say 
that to speak of love was impossible, but she 
stopped because she had seen by the sudden 
change in Natdsha two days before that she 
would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of 
his love, but that it was the very thing she 
wished for. 



648 



WAR AND PEACE 



"To speak to her now wouldn't do," said the 
princess all the same. 

"But what am I to do?" 

"Leave it to me," said Princess Mary. "I 
know . . ." 

Pierre was looking into Princess Mary's eyes. 

"Well? . . . Well? . . ." he said. 

"I know that she loves . . . will love you," 
Princess Mary corrected herself. 

Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung 
up and with a frightened expression seized 
Princess Mary's hand. 

"What makes you think so? You think I may 
hope? You think . . . ?" 

"Yes, I think so," said Princess Mary with a 
smile. "Write to her parents, and leave it to 
me. 1 will tell her when I can. I wish it to hap- 
pen and my heart tells me it will." 

"No, it cannot be I How happy I am! But it 
can't be. . . . How happy I am! No, it can't 
be!" Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess 
Mary's hands. 

"Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I 
will write to you," she said. 

"To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I'll go. 
But I may come again tomorrow?" 

Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Natisha 
was less animated than she had been the day 
before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre 
sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that 
neither he nor she existed any longer, that 
nothing existed but happiness. "Is it possible? 
No, it can't be," he told himself at every look, 
gesture, and word that filled his soul with 
joy. 

When on saying good-by he took her thin, 
slender hand, he could not help holding it a 
little longer in his own. 

"Is it possible that this hand, that face, those 
eyes, all this treasure of feminine charm so 
strange to me now, is it possible that it will 
one day be mine forever, as familiar to me as 
I am to myself? . . . No, that's impossible! . . ." 

"Good-by, Count," she said aloud. "I shall 
look forward very much to your return," she 
added in a whisper. 

And these simple words, her look, and the 
expression on her face which accompanied 
them, formed for two months the subject of in- 
exhaustible memories, interpretations, and 
happy meditations for Pierre. " 'I shall look 

forward very much to your return ' Yes, yes, 

how did she say it? Yes, 'I shall look forward 
very much to your return.' Oh, how happy I 
am! What is happening to me? How happy I 
ami" said Pierre to himself. 



CHAPTER XIX 

THERE WAS NOTHING in Pierre's soul now at all 
like what had troubled it during his courtship 
of H&amp;fcne. 

He did not repeat to himself with a sicken- 
ing feeling of shame the words he had spoken, 
or say: "Oh, why did I not say that?" and, 
"Whatever made me say 'Je vous aime'?" On 
the contrary, he now repeated in imagination 
every word that he or Natdsha had spoken and 
pictured every detail of her face and smile, 
and did not wish to diminish or add anything, 
but only to repeat it again and again. There 
was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as 
to whether what he had undertaken was right 
or wrong. Only one terrible doubt sometimes 
crossed his mind: "Wasn't it all a dream? Isn't 
Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too con- 
ceited and self-confident? I believe all this 
and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and 
she will be sure to smile and say: 'How strange! 
He must be deluding himself. Doesn't he know 
that he is a man, just a man, while I . . . ? I am 
something altogether different and higher.' " 

That was the only doubt often troubling 
Pierre. He did not now make any plans. The 
happiness before him appeared so inconceiv- 
able that if only he could attain it, it would be 
the end of all things. Everything ended with 
that. 

A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had 
thought himself incapable, possessed him. The 
whole meaning of lifenot for him alone but 
for the whole world seemed to him centered 
in his love and the possibility of being loved 
by her. At times everybody seemed to him to 
be occupied with one thing only his future 
happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that 
other people were all as pleased as he was him- 
self and merely tried to hide that pleasure by 
pretending to be busy with other interests. In 
every word and gesture he saw allusions to his 
happiness. He often surprised those he met by 
his significantly happy looks and smiles which 
seemed to express a secret understanding be- 
tween him and them. And when he realized 
that people might not be aware of his happi- 
ness, he pitied them with his whole heart and 
felt a desire somehow to explain to them that 
all that occupied them was a mere frivolous 
trifle unworthy of attention. 

When it was suggested to him that he should 
enter the civil service, or when the war or any 
general political affairs were discussed on the 
assumption that everybody's welfare depended 
on this or that issue of events, he would listen 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



64S 



with a mild and pitying smile and surprise 
people by his strange comments. But at this 
time he saw everybody both those who, as 
he imagined, understood the real meaning of 
life (that is, what he was feeling) and those 
unfortunates who evidently did not under- 
stand it in the bright light of the emotion that 
shone within himself, and at once without any 
effort saw in everyone he met everything that 
was good and worthy of being loved. 

When dealing with the affairs and papers 
of his dead wife, her memory aroused in him 
no feeling but pity that she had not known the 
bliss he now knew. Prince Vasili, who having 
obtained a new post and some fresh decora- 
tions was particularly proud at this time, 
seemed to him a pathetic, kindly old man much 
to be pitied. 

Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period 
of blissful insanity. All the views he formed 
of men and circumstances at this time re- 
mained true for him always. He not only did 
not renounce them subsequently, but when he 
was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he re- 
ferred to the views he had held at this time of 
his madness and they always proved correct. 

"I may have appeared strange and queer 
then," he thought, "but I was not so mad as I 
seemed. On the contrary 1 was then wiser and 
had more insight than at any other time, and 
understood all that is worth understanding 
in life, because . . . because I was happy." 

Pierre's insanity consisted in not waiting, as 
he used to do, to discover personal attributes 
which he termed "good qualities" in people 
before loving them; his heart was now over- 
flowing with love, and by loving people with- 
out cause he discovered indubitable causes for 
loving them. 

CHAPTER XX 

AFTER PIERRE'S DEPARTURE that first evening, 
when Natdsha had said to Princess Mary with 
a gaily mocking smile: "He looks just, yes, just 
as if he had come out of a Russian bath in a 
short coat and with his hair cropped," some- 
thing hidden and unknown to herself, but 
irrepressible, awoke in Natdsha's soul. 

Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, 
was suddenly altered. To her own surprise a 
power of life and hope of happiness rose to 
the surface and demanded satisfaction. From 
that evening she seemed to have forgotten all 
that had happened to her. She no longer com- 
plained of her position, did not say a word 
about the past, and no longer feared to make 



happy plans for the future. She spoke little of 
Pierre, but when Princess Mary mentioned 
him a long-extinguished light once more kin- 
dled in her eyes and her lips curved with a 
strange smile. 

The change that took place in Natasha at 
first surprised Princess Mary; but when she 
understood its meaning it grieved her. "Can 
she have loved my brother so little as to be 
able to forget him so soon?" she thought when 
she reflected on the change. But when she was 
with Natdsha she was not vexed with her and 
did not reproach her. The reawakened power 
of life that had seized Natasha was so evidently 
irrepressible and unexpected by her that in 
her presence Princess Mary felt that she had 
no right to reproach her even in her heart. 

Natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly 
to this new feeling that she did not try to hide 
the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright 
and cheerful. 

When Princess Mary returned to her room 
after her nocturnal talk with Pierre, Natdsha 
met her on the threshold. 

"He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?" she 
repeated. 

And a joyful yet pathetic expression which 
seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled 
on Natdsha's face. 

"1 wanted to listen at the door, but I knew 
you would tell me." 

Understandable and touching as the look 
with which Natasha gazed at her seemed to 
Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her 
agitation, these words pained her for a mo- 
ment. She remembered her brother and his 
love. 

"But what's to be done? She can't help it," 
thought the princess. 

And with a sad and rather stern look she 
told Natdsha all that Pierre had said. On hear- 
ing that he was going to Petersburg Natdsha 
was astounded. 

"To Petersburgl" she repeated as if unable 
to understand. 

But noticing the grieved expression on Prin- 
cess Mary's face she guessed the reason of that 
sadness and suddenly began to cry. 

"Mary," said she, "tell me what I should dol 
I am afraid of being bad. Whatever you tell 
me, I will do. Tell me " 

"You love him?" 

"Yes," whispered Natdsha. 

"Then why are you crying? I am happy for 
your sake," said Princess Mary, who because 
of those tears quite forgave Natdsha's joy. 



644 WAR AND PEACE 

"It won't be just yet someday. Think what They were silent awhile. 

fun it will be when I am his wife and you "But why go to Petersburg?" Natdsha sud- 

marry Nicholas!" denly asked, and hastily replied to her own 

"Natdsha, I have asked you not to speak of question. "But no, no, he must. . . . Yes, Mary, 

that. Let us talk about you." He must. . . ." 



First Epilogue: 1813-20 



CHAPTER I 

SEVEN YEARS had passed. The storm- tossed sea 
of European history had subsided within its 
shores and seemed to have become calm. But 
the mysterious forces that move humanity (mys- 
terious because the laws of their motion are un- 
known to us) continued to operate. 

Though the surface of the sea of history 
seemed motionless, the movement of humanity 
went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Var- 
ious groups of people formed and dissolved, 
the coming formation and dissolution of king- 
doms and displacement of peoples was in 
course of preparation. 

The sea of history was not driven spasmodi- 
cally from shore to shore as previously. It was 
seething in its depths. Historic figures were not 
borne by the waves from one shore to another 
as before. They now seemed to rotate on one 
spot. The historical figures at the head of ar- 
mies, who formerly reflected the movement of 
the masses by ordering wars, campaigns, and 
battles, now reflected the restless movement 
by political and diplomatic combinations, laws, 
and treaties. 

The historians call this activity of the histor- 
ical figures "the reaction." 

In dealing with this period they sternly con- 
demn the historical personages who, in their 
opinion, caused what they describe as the re- 
action. All the well-known people of that pe- 
riod, from Alexander and Napoleon to Ma- 
dame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Cha- 
teaubriand, and the rest, pass before their 
stern judgment seat and are acquitted or con- 
demned according to whether they conduced 
to progress or to reaction. 

According to their accounts a reaction took 
place at that time in Russia also, and the chief 
culprit was Alexander I, the same man who ac- 
cording to them was the chief cause of the lib- 
eral movement at the commencement of his 
reign, being the savior of Russia. 

There is no one in Russian literature now, 
from schoolboy essayist to learned historian, 



who does not throw his little stone at Alexan- 
der for things he did wrong at this period of 
his reign. 

"He ought to have acted in this way and in 
that way. In this case he did well and in that 
case badly. He behaved admirably at the be- 
ginning of his reign and during 1812, but act- 
ed badly by giving a constitution to Poland, 
forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power 
to Arakche"ev, favoring GoHtsyn and mysticism, 
and afterwards Shishk6v and Photius. He also 
acted badly by concerning himself with the ac- 
tive army and disbanding the Semenov regi- 
ment." 

It would take a dozen pages to enumerate 
all the reproaches the historians address to 
him, based on their knowledge of what is good 
for humanity. 

What do these reproaches mean? 

Do not the very actions for which the histo- 
rians praise Alexander I (the liberal attempts 
at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with 
Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 
and the campaign of 1813) flow from the same 
sourcesthe circumstances of his birth, educa- 
tion, and lifethat made his personality what 
it was and from which the actions for which 
they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the resto- 
ration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and 
later) also flowed? 

In what does the substance of those reproach- 
es lie? 

It lies in the fact that an historic character 
like Alexander I, standing on the highest pos- 
sible pinnacle of human power with the blind- 
ing light of history focused upon him; a char- 
acter exposed to those strongest of all influ- 
ences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception 
inseparable from power; a character who at 
every moment of his life felt a responsibility 
for all that was happening in Europe; and not 
a fictitious but a live character who like every 
man had his personal habits, passions, and im- 
pulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth 
that this character though not lacking in vir-

tue (the historians do not accuse him of that) 
had not the same conception of the welfare 
of humanity fifty years ago * as a present-day 
professor who from his youth upwards has 
been occupied with learning: that is, with 
books and lectures and with taking notes from 
them. 

But even if we assume that fifty years ago 
Alexander I was mistaken in his view of what 
was good for the people, we must inevitably 
assume that the historian who judges Alexan- 
der will also after the lapse of some time turn 
out to be mistaken in his view of what is good 
for humanity. This assumption is all the more 
natural and inevitable because, watching the 
movement of history, we sec that every year 
and with each new writer, opinion as to what 
is good for mankind changes; so that what 
once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, 
and vice versa. And what is more, we find at 
one and the same time quite contradictory 
views as to what is bad and what is good in his- 
tory: some people regard giving a constitu- 
tion to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance 
as praiseworthy in Alexander, while others re- 
gard it as blameworthy. 

The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon 
cannot be called useful or harmful, for it is 
impossible to say for what it was useful or 
harmful. If that activity displeases somebody, 
this is only because it does not agree with his 
limited understanding of what is good. Wheth- 
er the preservation of my father's house in 
Moscow, or the glory of the Russian arms, or 
the prosperity of the Petersburg and other uni- 
versities, or the freedom of Poland or the great- 
ness of Russia, or the balance of power in Eu- 
rope, or a certain kind of European culture 
called "progress" appear to me to be good or 
bad, I must admit that besides these things the 
action of every historic character has other 
more general purposes inaccessible to me. 

But let us assume that what is called science 
can harmonize all contradictions and possesses 
an unchanging standard of good and bad by 
which to try historic characters and events; let 
us say that Alexander could have done every- 
thing differently; let us say that with guidance 
from those who blame him and who profess to 
know the ultimate aim of the movement of hu- 
manity, he might have arranged matters ac- 
cording to the program his present accusers 
would have given him of nationality, freedom, 
equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the 
ground). Let us assume that this program was 

1 War and Peace was completed in 1869. TR. 



possible and had then been formulated, and 
that Alexander had acted on it. What would 
then have become of the activity of all those 
who opposed the tendency that then prevailed 
in the governmentan activity that in the 
opinion of the historians was good and benefi- 
cent? Their activity would not have existed: 
there would have been no life, there would 
have been nothing. 

If we admit that human life can be ruled by 
reason, the possibility of life is destroyed. 

CHAPTER II 

IF WE ASSUME as the historians do that great 
men lead humanity to the attainment of cer- 
tain ends the greatness of Russia or of France, 
the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion 
of the ideas of the Revolution, general prog- 
ress, or anything else then it is impossible 
to explain the facts of history without intro- 
ducing the conceptions of chance and genius. 

If the aim of the European wars at the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century had been 
the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might 
have been accomplished without all the pre- 
ceding wars and without the invasion. If the 
aim was the aggrandizement of France, that 
might have been attained without the Revolu- 
tion and without the Empire. If the aim was 
the dissemination of ideas, the printing press 
could have accomplished that much better 
than warfare. If the aim was the progress of 
civilization, it is easy to sec that there are other 
ways of diffusing civilization more expedient 
than by the destruction of wealth and of hu- 
man lives. 

Why did it happen in this and not in some 
other way? 

Because it happened so! "Chance created the 
situation; genius utilized it," says history. 

But what is chance? What is genius? 

The words chance and genius do not denote 
any really existing thing and therefore can- 
not be defined. Those words only denote a 
certain stage of understanding of phenomena. 
I do not know why a certain event occurs; I 
think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to 
know it and I talk about chance. I see a force 
producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary 
human agencies; I do not understand why this 
occurs and I talk of genius. 

To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman 
drives each evening into a special enclosure 
to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the 
others must seem to be a genius. And it must 
appear an astonishing conjunction of genius

with a whole series of extraordinary chances 
that this ram, who instead of getting into the 
general fold every evening goes into a special 
enclosure where there are oatsthat this very 
ram, swelling with fat, is killed for meat. 

But the rams need only cease to suppose that 
all that happens to them happens solely for 
the attainment of their sheepish aims; they 
need only admit that what happens to them 
may also have purposes beyond their ken, and 
they will at once perceive a unity and coher- 
ence in what happened to the ram that was 
fattened. Even if they do not know for what 
purpose they are fattened, they will at least 
know that all that happened to the ram did 
not happen accidentally, and will no longer 
need the conceptions of chance or genius. 

Only by renouncing our claim to discern a 
purpose immediately intelligible to us, and ad- 
mitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond 
our ken, may we discern the sequence of ex- 
periences in the lives of historic characters and 
perceive the cause of the effect they produce 
(incommensurable with ordinary human capa- 
bilities), and then the words chance and genius 
become superfluous. 

We need only confess that we do not know 
the purpose of the European convulsions and 
that we know only the facts that is, the mur- 
ders, first in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in 
Prussia, in Austria, in Spain, and in Russia 
and that the movements from the west to the 
east and from the east to the west form the es- 
sence and purpose of these events, and not 
only shall we have no need to see exceptional 
ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander, 
but we shall be unable to consider them to be 
anything but like other men, and we shall not 
be obliged to have recourse to chance for an 
explanation of those small events which made 
these people what they were, but it will be 
clear that all those small events were inevita- 
ble. 

By discarding a claim to knowledge of the 
ultimate purpose, we shall clearly perceive 
that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or 
seed for any single plant better suited to it than 
those it produces, so it is impossible to imagine 
any two people more completely adapted down 
to the smallest detail for the purpose they had 
to fulfill, than Napoleon and Alexander with 
all their antecedents. 

CHAPTER III 

THE FUNDAMENTAL and essential significance 
of the European events of the beginning of the 



nineteenth century lies in the movement of 
the mass of the European peoples from west 
to east and afterwards from east to west. The 
commencement of that movement was the 
movement from west to east. For the peoples of 
the west to be able to make their warlike move- 
ment to Moscow it was necessary: (i) that they 
should form themselves into a military group 
of a size able to endure a collision with the 
warlike military group of the east, (2) that 
they should abandon all established traditions 
and customs, and (3) that during their military 
movement they should have at their head a 
man who could justify to himself and to them 
the deceptions, robberies, and murders which 
would have to be committed during that move- 
ment. 

And beginning with the French Revolution 
the old inadequately large group was destroyed, 
as well as the old habits and traditions, and 
step by step a group was formed of larger di- 
mensions with new customs and traditions, 
and a man was produced who would stand at 
the head of the coming movement and bear 
the responsibility for all that had to be done. 

A man without convictions, without habits, 
without traditions, without a name, and not 
even a Frenchman, emerges by what seem 
the strangest chances from among all the 
seething French parties, and without joining 
any one of them is borne forward to a promi- 
nent position. 

The ignorance of his colleagues, the weak- 
ness and insignificance of his opponents, the 
frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling 
and self-confident limitations of this man raise 
him to the head of the army. The brilliant 
qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to 
Italy, his opponents' reluctance to fight, and 
his own childish audacity and self-confidence 
secure him military fame. Innumerable so- 
called chances accompany him everywhere. 
The disfavor into which he falls with the rul- 
ers of France turns to his advantage. His at- 
tempts to avoid his predestined path are un- 
successful: he is not received into the Russian 
service, and the appointment he seeks in Tur- . 
key comes to nothing. During the war in Italy 
he is several times on the verge of destruction 
and each time is saved in an unexpected man- 
ner. Owing to various diplomatic considera- 
tions the Russian armies just those which 
might have destroyed his prestige do not ap- 
pear upon the scene till he is no longer there. 

On his return from Italy he finds the gov- 
ernment in Paris in a process of dissolution in 



648 



WAR AND PEACE 



which all those who are in it are inevitably 
wiped out and destroyed. And by chance an 
escape from this dangerous position presents 
itself in the form of an aimless and senseless 
expedition to Africa. Again so-called chance 
accompanies him. Impregnable Malta surren- 
ders without a shot; his most reckless schemes 
are crowned with success. The enemy's fleet, 
which subsequently did not let a single boat 
pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In 
Africa a whole series of outrages are commit- 
ted against the almost unarmed inhabitants. 
And the men who commit these crimes, es- 
pecially their leader, assure themselves that 
this is admirable, this is glory it resembles 
Caesar and Alexander the Great and is there- 
fore good. 

This ideal of glory and grandeur which 
consists not merely in considering nothing 
wrong that one does but in priding oneself on 
every crime one commits, ascribing to it an in- 
comprehensible supernatural significance 
that ideal, destined to guide this man and his 
associates, had scope for its development in 
Africa. Whatever he does succeeds. The plague 
does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering 
prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault. His 
childishly rash, uncalled-for, and ignoble de- 
parture from Africa, leaving his comrades in 
distress, is set down to his credit, and again the 
enemy's fleet twice lets him slip past. When, 
intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so 
successfully, he reaches Paris, the dissolution 
of the republican government, which a year 
earlier might have ruined him, has reached its 
extreme limit, and his presence there now as a 
newcomer free from party entanglements can 
only serve to exalt him and though he him- 
self has no plan, he is quite ready for his new 
r61e. 

He had no plan, he was afraid of everything, 
but the parties snatched at him and demanded 
his participation. 

He alone with his ideal of glory and gran- 
deur developed in Italy and Egypt, his insane 
self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frank- 
ness in lyinghe alone could justify what had 
to be done. 

He is needed for the place that awaits him, 
and so almost apart from his will and despite 
his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his 
mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that 
aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is 
crowned with success. 

He is pushed into a meeting of the legisla- 
ture. In alarm he wishes to flee, considering 



himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon 
and says senseless things that should have 
ruined him. But the once proud and shrewd 
rulers of France, feeling that their part is 
played out, are even more bewildered than he, 
and do not say the words they should have said 
to destroy him and retain their power. 

Chance f millions of chances, give him power, 
and all men as if by agreement co-operate to 
confirm that power. Chance forms the charac- 
ters of the rulers of France, who submit to him; 
chance forms the character of Paul I of Russia 
who recognizes his government; chance con- 
trives a plot against him which not only fails 
to harm him but confirms his power. Chance 
puts the Due d'Enghien in his hands and un- 
expectedly causes him to kill him thereby con- 
vincing the mob more forcibly than in any 
other way that he had the right, since he had 
the might. Chance contrives that though he 
directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition 
against England (which would inevitably have 
ruined him) he never carries out that inten- 
tion, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and 
the Austrians, who surrender without a battle. 
Chance and genius give him the victory at 
Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the 
French but all Europe except England which 
does not take part in the events about to hap- 
pendespite their former horror and detesta- 
tion of his crimes, now recognize his authority, 
the title he has given himself, and his ideal of 
grandeur and glory, which seems excellentand 
reasonable to them all. 

As if measuring themselves and preparing 
for the coming movement, the western forces 
push toward the east several times in 1805, 
1806, 1807, and 1809, gaining strength and 
growing. In 1811 the group of people that had 
formed in France unites into one group with 
the peoples of Central Europe. The strength 
of the justification of the man who stands at 
the head of the movement grows with the in- 
creased size of the group. During the ten-year 
preparatory period this man had formed rela- 
tions with all the crowned heads of Europe. 
The discredited rulers of the world can op- 
pose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Na- 
poleonic ideal of glory and grandeur. One aft- 
er another they hasten to display their insig- 
nificance before him. The King of Prussia 
sends his wife to seek the great man's mercy; 
the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor 
that this man receives a daughter of the Caesars 
into his bed; the Pope, the guardian of all that 
the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for 



FIRST EPILOGUE 

the aggrandizement of the great man. It is not 
Napoleon who prepares himself for the accom- 
plishment of his role, so much as all those 
round him who prepare him to take on him- 
self the whole responsibility for what is hap- 
pening and has to happen. There is no step, 
no crime or petty fraud he commits, which in 
the mouths of those around him is not at once 
represented as a great deed. The most suitable 
fete the Germans can devise for him is a cele- 
bration of Jena and Auerstadt. Not only is he 
great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his 
stepsons, and his brothers-in-law. Everything 
is done to deprive him of the remains of his 
reason and to prepare him for his terrible 
part. And when he is ready so too are the forces. 

The invasion pushes eastward and reaches 
its final goalMoscow. That city is taken; the 
Russian army suffers heavier losses than the 
opposing armies had suffered in the former war 
from Austerlitz to Wagram. But suddenly in- 
stead of those chances and that genius which 
hitherto had so consistently led him by an un- 
interrupted series of successes to the predes- 
tined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse 
chances occur from the cold in his head at 
Borodin6 to the sparks which set Moscow on 
fire, and the frosts and instead of genius, stu- 
pidity and immeasurable baseness become evi- 
dent. 

The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and 
all the chances are now not for Napoleon but 
always against him. 

A countermovement is then accomplished 
from east to west with a remarkable resem- 
blance to the preceding movement from west 
to east. Attempted drives from east to west- 
similar to the contrary movements of 1805, 
1807, and 1809 precede the great westward 
movement; there is the same coalescence into 
a group of enormous dimensions; the same 
adhesion of the people of Central Europe to 
the movement; the same hesitation midway, 
and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is 
approached. 

Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Na- 
poleonic government and army are destroyed. 
Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; 
all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, 
but again an inexplicable chance occurs. The 
allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as 
the cause of their sufferings. Deprived of pow- 
er and authority, his crimes and his craft ex- 
posed, he should have appeared to them what 
he appeared ten years previously and one year 
lateran outlawed brigand. But by some 



649 

strange chance no one perceives this. His part 
is not yet ended. The man who ten years be- 
fore and a year later was considered an out- 
lawed brigand is sent to an island two days' 
sail from France, which for some reason is pre- 
sented to him as his dominion, and guards are 
given to him and millions of money are paid 
him. 



CHAPTER IV 

THE FLOOD OF NATIONS begins to subside into 
its normal channels. The waves of the great 
movement abate, and on the calm surface ed- 
dies are formed in which float the diplomatists, 
who imagine that they have caused the floods 
to abate. 

But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes 
disturbed. The diplomatists think that their 
disagreements are the cause of this fresh pres- 
sure of natural forces; they anticipate war be- 
tween their sovereigns; the position seems to 
them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be 
rising does not come from the quarter they 
expect. It rises again from the same point as 
before Paris. The last backwash of the move- 
ment from the west occurs: a backwash which 
serves to solve the apparently insuperable dip- 
lomatic difficulties and ends the military move- 
ment of that period of history. 

The man who had devastated France returns 
to France alone, without any conspiracy and' 
without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, 
but by a strange chance no one does so and all 
rapturously greet the man they cursed the day 
before and will curse again a month later. 

This man is still needed to justify the final 
collective act. 

That act is performed. 

The last role is played. The actor is bidden 
to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint: 
he will not be wanted any more. 

And some years pass during which he plays 
a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his 
island, justifying his actions by intrigues and 
lies when the justification is no longer needed, 
and displaying to the whole world what it was 
that people had mistaken for strength as long 
as an unseen hand directed his actions. 

The manager having brought the drama to 
a close and stripped the actor shows him to us. 

"See what you believed in! This is he I Do 
you now see that it was not he but I who 
moved you?" 

But dazed by the force of the movement, it 
was long before people understood this. 

Still greater coherence and inevitability is 



650 WAR AND PEACE 

seen in the life of Alexander I, the man who 
stood at the head of the countermovement 
from east to west. 

What was needed for him who, overshadow- 
ing others, stood at the head of that movement 
from east to west? 

What was needed was a sense of justice and 
a sympathy with European affairs, but a re- 
mote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; 
a moral superiority over those sovereigns of 
the day who co-operated with him; a mild and 
attractive personality; and a personal griev- 
ance against Napoleon. And all this was found 
in Alexander I; all this had been prepared by 
innumerable so-called chances in his life: his 
education, his early liberalism, the advisers 
who surrounded him, and by Austerlitz, and 
Tilsit, and Erfurt. 

During the national war he was inactive be- 
cause he was not needed. But as soon as the 
necessity for a general European war presented 
itself he appeared in his place at the given mo- 
ment and, uniting the nations of Europe, led 
them to the goal. 

The goal is reached. After the final war of 
1815 Alexander possesses all possible power. 
How does he use it? 

Alexander I the pacifier of Europe, the 
man who from his early years had striven only 
for his people's welfare, the originator of the 
liberal innovations in his fatherland now that 
he seemed to possess the utmost power and 
therefore to have the possibility of bringing 
about the welfare of his peoplesat the time 
when Napoleon in exile was drawing up child- 
ish and mendacious plans of how he would 
have made mankind happy had he retained 
power Alexander I, having fulfilled his mis- 
sion and feeling the hand of God upon him, 
suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that 
supposed power, turns away from it, and gives 
it into the hands of contemptible men whom 
he despises, saying only: 

"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy 
Name! ... I too am a man like the rest of you. 
Let me live like a man and think of my soul 
and of God." 

As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere 
complete in itself, and yet at the same time 
only a pan of a whole too immense for man to 
comprehend, so each individual has within 
himself his own aims and yet has them to serve 
a general purpose incomprehensible to man. 

A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. 
And the child is afraid of bees and declares 
that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires 



the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower 
and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flow- 
ers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen 
from flowers and carry it to the hive, says that 
it exists to gather honey. Another beekeeper 
who has studied the life of the hive more close- 
ly says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed 
the young bees and rear a queen, and that it 
exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices 
that the bee flying with the pollen'of a male 
flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees 
in this the purpose of the bee's existence. An- 
other, observing the migration of plants, no- 
tices that the bee helps in this work, and may 
say that in this lies the purpose of the bee. But 
the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhaust- 
ed by the first, the second, or any of the proc- 
esses the human mind can discern. The higher 
the human intellect rises in the discovery of 
these purposes, the more obvious it becomes 
that the ultimate purpose is beyond our com- 
prehension. 

All that is accessible to man is the relation 
of the life of the bee to other manifestations of 
life. And so it is with the purpose of historic 
characters and nations. 

CHAPTER V 

NATASHA'S WEDDING to Bezukhov, which took 
place in 1813, was the last happy event in the 
family of the old Rost6vs. Count Ilyd Rostov 
died that same year and, as always happens, 
after the father's death the family group broke 
up. 

The events of the previous year: the burn- 
ing of Moscow and the flight from it, the death 
of Prince Andrew, Natasha's despair, P^tya's 
death, and the old countess' grief fell blow aft- 
er blow on the old count's head. He seemed to 
be unable to understand the meaning of all 
these events, and bowed his old head in a spir- 
itual sense as if expecting and inviting further 
blows which would finish him. He seemed now 
frightened and distraught and now unnatural- 
ly animated and enterprising. 

The arrangements for Natasha's marriage 
occupied him for a while. He ordered dinners 
and suppers and obviously tried to appear 
cheerful, but his cheerfulness was not infec- 
tious as it used to be: on the contrary it evoked 
the compassion of those who knew and liked 
him. 

When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew 
very quiet and began to complain of depres- 
sion. A few days later he fell ill and took to his 
bed. He realized from the first that he would 



FIRST EPILOGUE 



651 



not get up again, despite the doctor's encour- 
agement. The countess passed a fortnight in 
an armchair by his pillow without undressing. 
Every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed 
and silently kissed her hand. On his last day, 
sobbing, he asked her and his absent son to 
forgive him for having dissipated their prop- 
ertythat being the chief fault of which he was 
conscious. After receiving communion and 
unction he quietly died; and next day a throng 
of acquaintances who came to pay their last 
respects to the deceased filled the house rented 
by the Rostovs. All these acquaintances, who 
had so often dined and danced at his house 
and had so often laughed at him, now said, 
with a common feeling of self-reproach and 
emotion, as if justifying themselves: "Well, 
whatever he may have been he was a most 
worthy man. You don't meet such men nowa- 
days. . . .And which of us has not weaknesses 
of his own?" 

It was just when the count's affairs had be- 
come so involved that it was impossible to say 
what would happen if he lived another year 
that he unexpectedly died. 

Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris 
when the news of his father's death reached 
him. He at once resigned his commission, and 
without waiting for it to be accepted took leave 
of absence and went to Moscow. The state of 
the count's affairs became quite obvious a 
month after his death, surprising everyone by 
the immense total of small debts the existence 
of which no one had suspected. The debts 
amounted to double the value of the property. 

Friends and relations advised Nicholas to 
decline the inheritance. But he regarded such 
a refusal as a slur on his father's memory, 
which he held sacred, and therefore would not 
hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance 
together with the obligation to pay the debts. 

The creditors who had so long been silent, 
restrained by a vague but powerful influence 
exerted on them while he lived by the count's 
careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce 
their claims at once. As always happens in 
such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should 
get paid first, and those who like Mitenka held 
promissory notes given them as presents now 
became the most exacting of the creditors. 
Nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace, 
and those who had seemed to pity the old man 
the cause of their losses (if they were losses) 
now remorselessly pursued the young heir 
who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and 
was obviously not guilty of contracting them. 



Not one of the plans Nicholas tried suc- 
ceeded; the estate was sold by auction for half 
its value, and half the debts still remained un- 
paid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand ru- 
bles offered him by his brother-in-law Beziik- 
hov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely 
due for value received. And to avoid being im- 
prisoned for the remainder, as the creditors 
threatened, he re-entered the government serv- 
ice. 

He could not rejoin the army where he 
would have been made colonel at the next va- 
cancy, for his mother now clung to him as her 
one hold on life; and so despite his reluctance 
to remain in Moscow among people who had 
known him before, and despite his abhorrence 
of the civil service, he accepted a post in Mos- 
cow in that service, doffed the uniform of 
which he was so fond, and moved with his 
mother and S6nya to a small house on the Sf- 
vtsev Vrazhek. 1 

Natdsha and Pierre were living in Peters- 
burg at the time and had no clear idea of 
Nicholas' circumstances. Having borrowed 
money from his brother-in-law, Nicholas tried 
to hide his wretched condition from him. His 
position was the more difficult because with 
his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not 
only to keep himself, his mother, and S6nya, 
but had to shield his mother from knowledge 
of their poverty. The countess could not con- 
ceive of life without the luxurious conditions 
she had been used to from childhood and, un- 
able to realize how hard it was for her son, 
kept demanding now a carriage (which they 
did not keep) to send for a friend, now some 
expensive article of food for herself, or wine 
for her son, or money to buy a present as a sur- 
prise for Natisha or S6nya, or for Nicholas 
himself. 

S6nya kept house, attended on her aunt, 
read to her, put up with her whims and secret 
ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their 
poverty from the old countess. Nicholas felt 
himself irredeemably indebted to Sonya for 
all she was doing for his mother and greatly 
admired her patience and devotion, but tried 
to keep aloof from her. 

He seemed in his heart to reproach her for 
being too perfect, and because there was noth- 
ing to reproach her with. She had all that peo- 
ple are valued for, but little that could have 
made him love her. He felt that the more he 
valued her the less he loved her. He had taken 
her at her word when she wrote giving him his

WAR AND PEACE 



freedom and now behaved as if all that had 
passed between them had been long forgotten 
and could never in any case be renewed. 

Nicholas* position became worse and worse. 
The idea of putting something aside out of his 
salary proved a dream. Not only did he not 
save anything, but to comply with his mother's 
demands he even incurred some small debts. 
He could see no way out of this situation. The 
idea of marrying some rich woman, which was 
suggested to him by his female relations, was 
repugnant to him. The other way out his 
mother's death never entered his head. He 
wished for nothing and hoped for nothing, 
and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy 
and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining en- 
durance of his position. He tried to avoid his 
old acquaintances with their commiseration 
and offensive offers of assistance; he avoided 
all distraction and recreation, and even at 
home did nothing but play cards with his 
mother, pace silently up and down the room, 
and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed 
carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy 
mood which alone enabled him to endure his 
position. i 

CHAPTER VI 

AT THE BEGINNING of winter Princess Mary 
came to Moscow. From reports current in town 
she learned how the Rost6vswere situated, and 
how "the son has sacrificed himself for his 
mother," as people were saying. 

"I never expected anything else of him," 
said Princess Mary to herself, feeling a joyous 
sense of her love for him. Remembering her 
friendly relations with all the Rost6vs which 
had made her almost a member of the family, 
she thought it her duty to go to see them. But 
remembering her relations with Nicholas in 
Vor6nezh she was shy about doing so. Making 
a great effort she did however go to call on 
them a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow. 

Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the 
countess' room could only be reached through 
his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure 
as she had expected, at his first glance at her 
his face assumed a cold, stiff, proud expression 
she had not seen on it before. He inquired 
about her health, led the way to his mother, 
and having sat there for five minutes left the 
room. 

When the princess came out of the countess' 
room Nicholas met her again, and with marked 
solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the 
anteroom. To her remarks about his mother's 



health he made no reply. "What's that to you? 
Leave me in peace," his looks seemed to say. 

"Why does she come prowling here? What 
does she want? I can't bear these ladies and all 
these civilities!" said he aloud in S6nya's pres- 
ence, evidently unable to repress his vexation, 
after the princess' carriage had disappeared. 

"Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?" 
cried S6nya, hardly able to conceal her delight. 
"She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of herl" 

Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid 
speaking of the princess any more. But after 
her visit the old countess spoke of her several 
times a day. 

She sang her praises, insisted that her son 
must call on her, expressed a wish to see her 
often, but yet always became ill-humored when 
she began to talk about her. 

Nicholas tried to keep silence when his 
mother spoke of the princess, but his silence ir- 
ritated her. 

"She is a very admirable and excellent young 
woman," said she, "and you must go and call 
on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, 
and I think it must be dull for you only seeing 
us." 

"But I don't in the least want to, Mamma." 

"You used to want to, and now you don't. 
Really I don't understand you, my dear. One 
day you are dull, and the next you refuse to 
see anyone." 

"But I never said I was dull." 

"Why, you said yourself you don't want 
even to see her. She is a very admirable young 
woman and you always liked her, but now 
suddenly you have got some notion or other in 
your head. You hide everything from me." 

"Not at all, Mamma." 

"If I were asking you to do something disa- 
greeable now but I only ask you to return a 
call. One would think mere politeness re- 
quired it. ... Well, I have asked you, and now 
I won't interfere any more since you have se- 
crets from your mother." 

"Well, then, I'll go if you wish it." 

"It doesn't matter to me. I only wish it for 
your sake." 

Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid 
out the cards for a patience, trying to divert 
his mother's attention to another topic. 

The same conversation was repeated next 
day and the day after, and the day after that. 

After her visit to the Rost6vs and her unex- 
pectedly chilly reception by Nicholas, Prin- 
cess Mary confessed to herself that she had 
been right in not wishing to be the first to call. 



FIRST EPILOGUE 



"I expected nothing else," she told herself, 
calling her pride to her aid. "I have nothing to 
do with him and I only wanted to see the old 
lady, who was always kind to me and to whom 
I am under many obligations." 

But she could not pacify herself with these 
reflections; a feeling akin to remorse troubled 
her when she thought of her visit. Though she 
had firmly resolved not to call on the Rost6vs 
again and to forget the whole matter, she felt 
herself all the time in an awkward position. And 
when she asked herself what distressed her, she 
had to admit that it was her relation to Rostov. 
His cold, polite manner did not express his 
feeling for her (she knew that) but it con- 
cealed something, and until she could discover 
what that something was, she felt that she 
could not be at ease. 

One day in midwinter when sitting in the 
schoolroom attending to her nephew's lessons, 
she was informed that Rost6v had called. With 
a firm resolution not to betray herself and not 
show her agitation, she sent for Mademoiselle 
Bourienne and went with her to the drawing 
room. 

Her first glance at Nicholas* face told her 
that he had only come to fulfill the demands 
of politeness, and she firmly resolved to main- 
tain the tone in which he addressed her. 

They spoke of the countess* health, of their 
mutual friends, of the latest war news, and 
when the ten minutes required by propriety 
had elapsed after which a visitor may rise, 
Nicholas got up to say good-by. 

With Mademoiselle Bourienne's help the 
princess had maintained the conversation very 
well, but at the very last moment, just when 
he rose, she was so tired of talking of what did 
not interest her, and her mind was so full of 
the question why she alone was granted so lit- 
tle happiness in life, that in a fit of absent- 
mindedness she sat still, her luminous eyes 
gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he 
had risen. 

Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to ap- 
pear not to notice her abstraction, made some 
remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then 
again looked at the princess. She still sat mo- 
tionless with a look of suffering on her gentle 
face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was 
vaguely conscious that he might be the cause 
of the sadness her face expressed. He wished to 
help her and say something pleasant, but could 
think of nothing to say. 

"Good-by, Princess!" said he. 

She started, flushed, and sighed deeply. 



653 



"Oh, I beg your pardon/' she said as if wak- 
ing up. "Are you going already, Count? Well 
then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the 
countess!" 

"Wait a moment, I'll fetch it," said Made- 
moiselle Bourienne, and she left the room. 

They both sat silent, with an occasional 
glance at one another. 

"Yes, Princess," said Nicholas at last with a 
sad smile, "it doesn't seem long ago since we 
first met at Boguchdrovo, but how much water 
has flowed since then! In what distress we all 
seemed to be then, yet I would give much to 
bring back that time . . . but there's no bring- 
ing it back." 

Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes 
with her own luminous ones as he said this. 
She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden 
meaning of his words which would explain his 
feeling for her. 

"Yes, yes," said she, "but you have no reason 
to regret the past, Count. As I understand your 
present life, I think you will always recall it 
with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that 
fills it now . . ." 

"I cannot accept your praise," he interrupted 
her hurriedly. "On the contrary I continually 
reproach myself. . . . But this is not at all an 
interesting or cheerful subject." 

His face again resumed its former stiff and 
cold expression. But the princess had caught a 
glimpse of the man she had known and loved, 
and it was to him that she now spoke. 

"I thought you would allow me to tell you 
this," she said. "I had come so near to you . . . 
and to all your family that I thought you would 
not consider my sympathy misplaced, but I 
was mistaken," and suddenly her voice trem- 
bled. "I don't know why," she continued, re- 
covering herself, "but you used to be different, 
and . . ." 

"There are a thousand reasons why! 9 laying 
special emphasis on the why. "Thank you, 
Princess," he added softly. "Sometimes it is 
hard." 

"So that's why! That's why!" a voice whis- 
pered in Princess Mary's soul. "No, it was not 
only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only 
that handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I 
divined his noble, resolute, self-sacrificing spirit 
too," she said to herself. "Yes, he is poor now 
and I am rich. . . . Yes, that's the only reason. 
. . . Yes, were it not for that . . ."And remem- 
bering his former tenderness, and looking now 
at his kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly un- 
derstood the cause of his coldness. 



654 



WAR AND PEACE 



"But why, Count, why?" she almost cried, 
unconsciously moving closer to him. "Why? 
Tell me. You must tell me!" 

He was silent. 

"I don't understand your why, Count," she 
continued, "but it's hard for me ... I confess 
it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of 
our former friendship. And that hurts me." 
There were tears in her eyes and in her voice. 
"I have had so little happiness in life that every 
loss is hard for me to bear. . . . Excuse me, 
good-by!" and suddenly she began to cry and 
was hurrying from the room. 

"Princess, for God's sake!" he exclaimed, try- 
ing to stop her. "Princess!" 

She turned round. For a few seconds they 
gazed silently into one another's eyes and 
what had seemed impossible and remote sud- 
denly became possible, inevitable, and very 
near. 

CHAPTER VII 

IN THE WINTER of 1813 Nicholas married Prin- 
cess Mary and moved to Bald Hills with his 
wife, his mother, and S6nya. 

Within four years he had paid off all his re- 
maining debts without selling any of his wife's 
property, and having received a small inherit- 
ance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt 
to Pierre as well. 

In another three years, by 1820, he had so 
managed his affairs that he was able to buy a 
small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was ne- 
gotiating to buy back Otrddnoe that being 
his pet dream. 

Having started farming from necessity, he 
soon grew so devoted to it that it became his 
favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nich- 
olas was a plain farmer: he did not like inno- 
vations, especially the English ones then com- 
ing into vogue. He laughed at theoretical 
treatises on estate management, disliked fac- 
tories, the raising of expensive products, and 
the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not 
make a hobby of any particular part of the 
work on his estate. He always had before his 
mind's eye the estate as a whole and not any 
particular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes 
was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxy- 
gen in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, 
but that most important agent by which nitro- 
gen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made ef- 
fectivethe peasant laborer. When Nicholas 
first began farming and began to understand 
its different branches, it was the serf who es- 
pecially attracted his attention. The peasant 



seemed to him not merely a tool, but also a 
judge of farming and an end in himself. At 
first he watched the serfs, trying to understand 
their aims and what they considered good and 
bad, and only pretended to direct them and 
give orders while in reality learning from them 
their methods, their manner of speech, and 
their judgment of what was good and bad. 
Only when he had understood the peasants' 
tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk their 
language, to grasp the hidden meaning of 
their words, and felt akin to them did he be- 
gin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to per- 
form toward them the duties demanded of 
him. And Nicholas' management produced 
very brilliant results. 

Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up 
the management of the estates he at once un- 
erringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and 
delegate, the very men the serfs would them- 
selves have chosen had they had the right to 
choose, and these posts never changed hands. 
Before analyzing the properties of manure, be- 
fore entering into the debit and credit (as he 
ironically called it), he found out how many 
cattle the peasants had and increased the num- 
ber by all possible means. He kept the peasant 
families together in the largest groups possible, 
not allowing the family groups to divide into 
separate households. He was hard alike on the 
lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to 
get them expelled from the commune. 

He was as careful of the sowing and reaping 
of the peasants' hay and corn as of his own, 
and few landowners had their crops sown and 
harvested so early and so well, or got so good a 
return, as did Nicholas. 

He disliked having anything to do with the 
domestic serfs the "drones" as he called them 
and everyone said he spoiled them by his 
laxity. When a decision had to be taken re- 
garding a domestic serf, especially if one had 
to be punished, he always felt undecided and 
consulted everybody in the house; but when it 
was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted 
instead of a land worker he did so without the 
least hesitation. He never felt any hesitation 
in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his 
every decision would be approved by them all 
with very few exceptions. 

He did not allow himself either to be hard 
on or punish a man, or to make things easy for 
or reward anyone, merely because he felt in- 
clined to do so. He could not have said by what 
standard he judged what he should or should 
not do, but the standard was quite firm and 



definite in his own mind. 

Often, speaking with vexation of some fail- 
ure or irregularity, he would say: "What can 
one do with our Russian peasants?" and imag- 
ined that he could not bear them. 

Yet he loved "our Russian peasants" and 
their way of life with his whole soul, and for 
that very reason had understood and assimi- 
lated the one way and manner of farming 
which produced good results. 

Countess Mary was jealous of this passion of 
her husband's and regretted that she could not 
share it; but she could not understand the joys 
and vexations he derived from that world, to 
her so remote and alien. She could not under- 
stand why he was so particularly animated and 
happy when, after getting up at daybreak and 
spending the whole morning in the fields or 
on the threshing floor, he returned from the 
sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with 
her. She did not understand why he spoke with 
such admiration and delight of the farming of 
the thrifty and well-to-do peasant Matthew 
Ermishin, who with his family had carted corn 
all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas') 
sheaves were already stacked before anyone 
else had his harvest in. She did not understand 
why he stepped out from the window to the 
veranda and smiled under his mustache and 
winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain be- 
gan to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the 
young oats, or why when the wind carried away 
a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he 
would return from the barn, flushed, sun- 
burned, and perspiring, with a smell of worm- 
wood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully 
rubbing his hands, would say: "Well, one more 
day and my grain and the peasants' will all be 
under cover." 

Still less did she understand why he, kind- 
hearted and always ready to anticipate her 
wishes, should become almost desperate when 
she brought him a petition from some peasant 
men or women who had appealed to her to be 
excused some work; why he, that kind Nicho- 
las, should obstinately refuse her, angrily ask- 
ing her not to interfere in what was not her 
business. She felt he had a world apart, which 
he loved passionately and which had laws she 
had not fathomed. 

Sometimes when, trying to understand him, 
she spoke of the good work he was doing for 
his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: "Not in 
the least; it never entered my head and I 
wouldn't do that for their goodl That's all 
poetry and old wives' talkall that doing good 



FIRST EPILOGUE 655 

to one's neighborl What I want is that our 



children should not have to go begging. I must 
put our affairs in order while I am alive, that's 
all. And to do that, order and strictness are 
essential. . . . That's all about it!" said he, 
clenching his vigorous fist. "And fairness, of 
course," he added, "for if the peasant is naked 
and hungry and has only one miserable horse, 
he can do no good either for himself or for 
me." 

And all Nicholas did was fruitful probably 
just because he refused to allow himself to 
think that he was doing good to others for vir- 
tue's sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs 
from neighboring estates came to beg him to 
buy them, and long after his death the memory 
of his administration was devoutly preserved 
among the serfs. "He was a master . . . the peas- 
ants' affairs first and then his own. Of course 
he was not to be trifled with either in a word, 
he was a real masterl" 

CHAPTER VIII 

ONE MATTER connected with his management 
sometimes worried Nicholas, and that was his 
quick temper together with his old hussar hab- 
it of making free use of his fists. At first he saw 
nothing reprehensible in this, but in the sec- 
ond year of his marriage his view of that form 
of punishment suddenly changed. 

Once in summer he had sent for the village 
elder from Boguchdrovo, a man who had suc- 
ceeded to the post when Dron died and who 
was accused of dishonesty and various irregu- 
larities. Nicholas went out into the porch to 
question him, and immediately after the elder 
had given a few replies the sound of cries and 
blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nich- 
olas went up to his wife, who sat with her head 
bent low over her embroidery frame, and as 
usual began to tell her what he had been do- 
ing that morning. Among other things he spoke 
of the Boguchclrovo elder. Countess Mary 
turned red and then pale, but continued to sit 
with head bowed and lips compressed and gave 
her husband no reply. 

"Such an insolent scoundrel! "he cried, grow- 
ing hot again at the mere recollection of him. 
"If he had told me he was drunk and did not 
see ... But what is the matter with you, Mary?" 
he suddenly asked. 

Countess Mary raised her head and tried to 
speak, but hastily looked down again and her 
lips puckered. 

"Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest^" 

The looks of the plain Countess Mary always 



6 5 6 

improved when she was in tears. She never 
cried from pain or vexation, but always from 
sorrow or pity, and when she wept her radiant 
eyes acquired an irresistible charm. 

The moment Nicholas took her hand she 
could no longer restrain herself and began to 
cry. 

"Nicholas, I saw it ... he was to blame, but 
why do you . . . Nicholas!" and she covered her 
face with her hands. 

Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, 
left her side, and paced up and down the room. 
He understood what she was weeping about, 
but could not in his heart at once agree with 
her that what he had regarded from childhood 
as quite an everyday event was wrong. "Is it 
just sentimentality, old wives' tales, or is she 
right?" he asked himself. Before he had solved 
that point he glanced again at her face filled 
with love and pain, and he suddenly realized 
that she was right and that he had long been 
sinning against himself. 

"Mary," he said softly, going up to her, "it 
will never happen again; I give you my word. 
Never," he repeated in a trembling voice like 
a boy asking for forgiveness. 

The tears flowed faster still from the count- 
ess' eyes. She took his hand and kissed it. 

"Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?" 
she asked to change the subject, looking at his 
finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of 
Laocoon's head. 

"Today it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, 
don't remind me of ill" and again he flushed. 
"I give you my word of honor it shan't occur 
again, and let this always be a reminder to me," 
and he pointed to the broken ring. 

After that, when in discussions with his vil- 
lage elders or stewards the blood rushed to his 
face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas 
would turn the broken ring on his finger and 
would drop his eyes before the man who was 
making him angry. But he did forget himself 
once or twice within a twelvemonth, and then 
he would go and confess to his wife, and would 
again promise that this should really be the 
very last time. 

"Mary, you must despise mel" he would say. 
"I deserve it." 

"You should go, go away at once, if you don't 
feel itrong enough to control yourself," she 
would reply sadly, trying to comfort her hus- 
band. 

Among the gentry of the province Nicholas 
was respected but not liked. He did not con- 
cern himself with the interests of his own class, 



WAR AND PEACE 

and consequently some thought him proud and 
others thought him stupid. The whole sum- 
mer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was 
busy with the work on his farm. In autumn he 
gave himself up to hunting with the same busi- 
nesslike seriousness leaving home for a month, 
or even two, with his hunt. In winter he visited 
his other villages or spent his time reading. 
The books he read were chiefly historical, and 
on these he spent a certain sum every year. He 
was collecting, as he said, a serious library, and 
he made it a rule to read through all the books 
he bought. He would sit in his study with a 
grave air, reading a task he first imposed up- 
on himself as a duty, but which afterwards be- 
came a habit affording him a special kind of 
pleasure and a consciousness of being occu- 
pied with serious matters. In winter, except 
for business excursions, he spent most of his 
time at home making himself one with his 
family and entering into all the details of his 
children's relations with their mother. The 
harmony between him and his wife grew closer 
and closer and he daily discovered fresh spir- 
itual treasures in her. 

From the time of his marriage S6nya had 
lived in his house. Before that, Nicholas had 
told his wife all that had passed between him- 
self andS6nya, blaming himself and commend- 
ing her. He had asked Princess Mary to be 
gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly 
realized the wrong he had doneS6nya, felt her- 
self to blame toward her, and imagined that 
her wealth had influenced Nicholas' choice. 
She could not find fault with S6nya in any way 
and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill- 
will toward her which she could not overcome. 

Once she had a talk with her friend Natasha 
about S6nya and about her own injustice to- 
ward her. 

"You know," said Natasha, "you have read 
the Gospels a great deal there is a passage in 
them that just fits S6nya." 

"What?" asked Countess Mary, surprised. 

" 'To him that hath shall be given, and from 
him that hath not shall be taken away.' You 
remember? She is one that hath not; why, I 
don't know. Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don't 
know, but from her is taken away, and every- 
thing has been taken away. Sometimes I am 
dreadfully sorry for her. Formerly I very much 
wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always 
had a sort of presentiment that it would not 
come off. She is a sterile flower, you know- 
like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I 
am sorry for her, and sometimes I think she 



FIRST EPILOGUE 

doesn't feel it as you or I would." 

Though Countess Mary told Natdsha that 
those words in the Gospel must be understood 
differently, yet looking at S6nya she agreed 
with Natasha's explanation. It really seemed 
that S6nya did not feel her position trying, and 
had grown quite reconciled toherlotasa$ter//e 
flower. She seemed to be fond not so much of 
individuals as of the family as a whole. Like a 
cat, she had attached herself not to the people 
but to the home. She waited on the old count- 
ess, petted and spoiled the children, was al- 
ways ready to render the small services for 
which she had a gift, and all this was uncon- 
sciously accepted from her with insufficient 
gratitude. 

The country seat at Bald Hills had been re- 
built, though not on the same scale as under 
the old prince. 

The buildings, begun under straitened cir- 
cumstances, were more than simple. The im- 
mense house on the old stone foundations was 
of wood, plastered only inside. It had bare 
deal floors and was furnished with very simple 
hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made 
by their own serf carpenters out of their own 
birchwood. The house was spacious and had 
rooms for the house serfs and apartments for 
visitors. Whole families of the Rostovs' and 
Bolk6nskis' relations sometimes came to Bald 
Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of serv- 
ants and stayed for months. Besides that, four 
times a year, on the name days and birthdays 
of the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors 
would gather there for a day or two. The rest 
of the year life pursued its unbroken routine 
with its ordinary occupations, and its break- 
fasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers, provided 
out of the produce of the estate. 



657 



CHAPTER IX 

IT WAS the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of De- 
cember, 1820. Natasha had been staying at her 
brother's with her husband and children since 
early autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg 
on business of his own for three weeks as he 
said, but had remained there nearly seven 
weeks and was expected back every minute. 

Besides the Beziikhov family, Nicholas' old 
friend t the retired General Vasili Dmitrich 
Denisov was staying with the Rost6vs this fifth 
of December. 

On the sixth, which was his name day when 
the house would be full of visitors, Nicholas 
knew he would have to exchange his Tartar 
tunic for a tail coat, and put on narrow boots 



with pointed toes, and drive to the new church 
he had built, and then receive visitors who 
would come to congratulate him, offer them re- 
freshments, and talk about the elections of the 
nobility; but he considered himself entitled to 
spend the eve of that day in his usual way. He 
examined the bailiff's accounts of the village 
in Ryazan which belonged to his wife's neph- 
ew, wrote two business letters, and walked over 
to the granaries, cattle yards and stables be- 
fore dinner. Having taken precautions against 
the general drunkenness to be expected on the 
morrow because it was a great saint's day, he 
returned to dinner, and without having time 
for a private talk with his wife sat down at 
the long table laid for twenty persons, at 
which the whole household had assembled. At 
that table were his mother, his mother's old 
lady companion Bel6va, his wife, their three 
children with their governess and tutor, his 
wife's nephew with his tutor, S6nya, Denisov, 
Natasha, her three children, their governess, 
and old Michael Ivnovich,the late prince's ar- 
chitect, who was living on in retirement at 
Bald Hills. 

Countess Mary sat at the other end of the 
table. When her husband took his place she 
concluded, from the rapid manner in which 
after taking up his table napkin he pushed 
back the tumbler and wineglass standing be- 
fore him, that he was out of humor, as was 
sometimes the case when he came in to din- 
ner straight from the farm especially before 
the soup. Countess Mary well knew that mood 
of his, and when she herself was in agood frame 
of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup 
and then began to talk to him and make him 
admit that there was no cause for his ill-humor. 
But today she quite forgot that and was hurt 
that he should be angry with her without any 
reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked him 
where he had been. He replied. She again in- 
quired whether everything was going well on 
the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince 
unpleasantly and he replied hastily. 

"Then I'm not mistaken," thought Countess 
Mary. "Why is he cross with me?" She conclud- 
ed from his tone that he was vexed with her 
and wished to end the conversation. She knew 
her remarks sounded unnatural, but could not 
refrain from asking some more questions. 

Thanks to Denfsov the conversation at table 
soon became general and lively, and she did 
not talk to her husband. When they left the 
table and went as usual to thank the old count- 
ess, Countess Mary held out her hand and 



6 5 8 



WAR AND PEACE 



kissed her husband, and asked him why he was 
angry with her. 

"You always have such strange fancies! I 
didn't even think of being angry," he replied. 

But the word always seemed to her to im- 
ply: "Yes, I am angry but I won't tell you why." 

Nicholas and his wife lived together so hap- 
pily that even S6nya and the old countess, who 
felt jealous and would have liked them to dis- 
agree, could find nothing to reproach them 
with; but even they had their moments of an- 
tagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just 
after they had been happiest together, they 
suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and 
hostility, which occurred most frequently dur- 
ing Countess Mary's pregnancies, and this was 
such a time. 

"Well, messieurs et mesdames" said Nicho- 
las loudly and with apparent cheerfulness (it 
seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on pur- 
pose to vex her), "I have been on my feet since 
six this morn ing. Tomorrow I shall have tosuf- 
fer, so today I'll go and rest." 

And without a word to his wife he went to 
the little sitting room and lay down on the 
sofa. 

"That's always the way," thought Countess 
Mary. "He talks to everyone except me. I see 
... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially 
when I am in this condition." She looked down 
at her expanded figure and in the glass at her 
pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes 
now looked larger than ever. 

And everything annoyed her Denfsov's 
shouting and laughter, Natasha's talk, and es- 
pecially a quick glance S6nya gave her. 

S6nya was always the first excuse Countess 
Mary found for feeling irritated. 

Having sat awhile with her visitors without 
understanding anything of what they were 
saying, she softly left the room and went to 
the nursery. 

The children were playing at "going to Mos- 
cow" in a carriage made of chairs and invited 
her to go with them. She sat down and played 
with them a little, but the thought of her hus- 
band and his unreasonable crossness worried 
her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with 
difficulty, went to the small sitting room. 

"Perhaps he is not asleep; I'll have an ex- 
planation with him," she said to herself. Little 
Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother, 
followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him. 

"Mary, dear, I think he is asleephe was so 
tired," said S6nya, meeting her in the large 
sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that 



she crossed her path everywhere). "Andrew 
may wake him." 

Countess Mary looked round, saw little An- 
drew following her, felt that S6nya was right, 
and for that very reason flushed and with evi- 
dent difficulty refrained from saying something 
harsh. She made no reply, but to avoid obeying 
S6nya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quiet- 
ly and went to the door. S6nya went away by 
another door. From the room in which Nicho- 
las was sleeping came the sound of his even 
breathing, every slightest tone of which was fa- 
miliar to his wife. As she listened to it she saw 
before her his smooth handsome forehead, his 
mustache, and his whole face, as she had so 
often seen it in the stillness of the night when 
he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared 
his throat. And at that moment little Andrew 
shouted from outside the door: "Papa! Mam- 
ma's standing herel" Countess Mary turned 
pale with fright and made signs to the boy. 
He grew silent, and quiet ensued fora moment, 
terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how 
Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through 
the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat 
again and stirring, and his voice said crossly: 

"I can't get a moment's peace. . . . Mary, is 
that you? Why did you bring him here?" 

"I only came in to look and did not notice 
. . . forgive me. . . ." 

Nicholas coughed and said no more. Count- 
ess Mary moved away from the door and took 
the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later 
little black-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her 
father's pet, having learned from her brother 
that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the 
sitting room, ran to her father unobserved by 
her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly 
opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa 
with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs, 
and having examined the position of her fa- 
ther, who was asleep with his back to her, rose 
on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under 
his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile 
on his face. 

"Natdsha, Natasha!" came Countess Mary's 
frightened whisper from the door. "Papa wants 
to sleep." 

"No, Mamma, he doesn't want to sleep," said 
little Natdsha with conviction. "He's laugh- 
ing." 

Nicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took 
his daughter in his arms. 

"Come in, Mary," he said to his wife. 

She went in and sat down by her husband. 

"I did not notice him following me/' she 



FIRST EPILOGUE 

said timidly. "I just looked in." 

Holding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas 
glanced at his wife and, seeing her guilty ex- 
pression, put his other arm around her and 
kissed her hair. 

"May I kiss Mamma?" he asked Natasha. 

Natasha smiled bashfully. 

"Again I" she commanded, pointing with a 
peremptory gesture to the spot where Nicho- 
las had placed the kiss. 

"I don't know why you think I am cross," 
said Nicholas, reply ing to the question he knew 
was in his wife's mind. 

"You have no idea how unhappy, how lone- 
ly, I feel when you are like that. It always seems 
to me . . ." 

"Mary, don't talk nonsense. You ought to be 
ashamed of yourself 1" he said gaily. 

"It seems to be that you can't love me, that 
I am so plain . . . always . . . and now ... in 
this cond . . ." 

"Oh, how absurd you arel It is not beauty 
that endears, it's love that makes us see beauty. 
It is only Malvinas and women of that kind 
who are loved for their beauty. But do I love 
my wife? I don't love her, but ... I don't know 
how to put it. Without you, or when some- 
thing comes between us like this, I seem lost 
and can't do anything. Now do I love my fin- 
ger? I don't love it, but just try to cut it offl" 

"I'm not like that myself, but I understand. 
So you're not angry with me?" 

"Awfully angry!" he said, smiling and get- 
ting up. And smoothing his hair he began to 
pace the room. 

"Do you know, Mary, what I've been think- 
ing?" he began, immediately thinking aloud 
in his wife's presence now that they had made 
it up. 

He did not ask if she was ready to listen to 
him. He did not care. A thought had occurred 
to him and so it belonged to her also. And he 
told her of his intention to persuade Pierre to 
stay with them till spring. 

Countess Mary listened till he had finished, 
made some remark, and in her turn began 
thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the 
children. 

"You can see the woman in her already," 
she sajfl in French, pointing to little Natasha. 
"You reproach us women with being illogical. 
Here is our logic. I say: 'Papa wants to sleep!' 
but she says, 'No, he's laughing.' And she was 
right," said Countess Mary with a happy smile. 

"Yes, yes." And Nicholas, taking his little 
daughter in his strong hand, lifted her high, 



6 59 

placed her on his shoulder, held her by the 
legs, and paced the room with her. There was 
an expression of carefree happiness on the 
faces of both father and daughter. 

"But you know you may be unfair. You are 
too fond of this one," his wife whispered in 
French. 

"Yes, but what am I to do? ... I try not to 
show . . ." 

At that moment they heard the sound of the 
door pulley and footsteps in the hall and ante- 
room, as if someone had arrived. 

"Somebody has come." 

"I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see," said 
Countess Mary and left the room. 

In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to 
give his little daughter a gallop round the 
room. Out of breath, he took the laughing 
child quickly from his shoulder and pressed 
her to his heart. His capers reminded him of 
dancing, and looking at the child's round hap- 
py little face he thought of what she would be 
like when he was an old man, taking her into 
society and dancing the mazurka with her as 
his old father had danced Daniel Cooper with 
his daughter. 

"It is he, it is he, Nicholas!" said Countess 
Mary, re-entering the room a few minutes lat- 
er. "Now our Natdsha has come to life. You 
should have seen her ecstasy, and how he caught 
it for having stayed away so long. Well, come 
along now, quick, quick! It's time you two were 
parted," she added, looking smilingly at the 
little girl who clung to her father. 

Nicholas went out holding the child by the 
hand. 

Countess Mary remained in the sittingroom. 

"I should never, never have believed that 
one could be so happy," she whispered to her- 
self. A smile lit up her face but at the same 
time she sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a 
quiet sadness as though she felt, through her 
happiness, that there is another sort of hap- 
piness unattainable in this life and of which 
she involuntarily thought at that instant. 

CHAPTER X 

NATASHA HAD MARRIED in the early spring of 
1813, and in 1820 already had three daughters 
besides a son for whom she had longed and 
whom she was now nursing. She had grown 
stouter and broader, so that it was difficult to 
recognize in this robust, motherly woman the 
slim, lively Natdsha of former days. Hfer fea- 
tures were more defined and had a calm, soft, 
and serene expression. In her face there was 



66o 



WAR AND PEACE 



none of the ever-glowing animation that had 
formerly burned there and constituted its 
charm. Now her face and body were often all 
that one saw, and her soul was not visible at 
all. All that struck the eye was a strong, hand- 
some, and fertile woman. The old fire very 
rarely kindled in her face now. That happened 
only when, as was the case that day, her hus- 
band returned home, or a sick child was conva- 
lescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke 
of Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him 
to her husband, who she imagined was jealous 
of Prince Andrew's memory), or on the rare 
occasions when something happened to induce 
her to sing, a practice she had quite abandoned 
since her marriage. At the rare moments when 
the old fire did kindle in her handsome, fully 
developed body she was even more attractive 
than in former days. 

Since their marriage Natasha and her hus- 
band had lived in Moscow, in Petersburg, on 
their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, 
that is to say, in Nicholas' house. The young 
Countess Beziikhova was not often seen in so- 
ciety, and those who met her there were not 
pleased with her and found her neither at- 
tractive nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked 
solitude she did not know whether she liked 
it or not, she even thought that she did riot- 
but with her pregnancies, her confinements, 
the nursing of her children, and sharing every 
moment of her husband's life, she had de- 
mands on her time which could be satisfied 
only byrenouncingsociety. All who had known 
Natasha before her marriage wondered at the 
change in her as at something extraordinary. 
Only the old countess with her maternal in- 
stinct had realized that all Natasha's outbursts 
had been due to her need of children and a 
husband as she herself had once exclaimed at 
Otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest 
and her mother was now surprised at the sur- 
prise expressed by those who had never under- 
stood Natasha, and she kept saying that she 
had always known that Natasha would make 
an exemplary wife and mother. 

"Only she lets her love of her husband and 
children overflow all bounds," said the count- 
ess, "so that it even becomes absurd." 

Natasha did not follow the golden rule ad- 
vocated by clever folk, especially by the French, 
which says that a girl should not let herself go 
when she marries, should not neglect her ac- 
complishments, should be even more careful 
of her appearance than when she was unmar- 
ried, and should fascinate her husband as much 



as she did before he became her husband. Na- 
tasha on the contrary had at once abandoned 
all her witchery, of which her singing had been 
an unusually powerful part. She gave it up 
just because it was so powerfully seductive. 
She took no pains with her manners or with 
delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show 
herself to her husband in her most becoming 
attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him 
by being too exacting. She acted in contradic- 
tion to all those rules. She felt that the allure- 
ments instinct had formerly taught her to use 
would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of 
her husband, to whom she had from the first 
moment given herself up entirely that is, with 
her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden 
from him. She felt that her unity with her hus- 
band was not maintained by the poetic feel- 
ings that had attracted him to her, but by 
something else indefinite but firm as the bond 
between her own body and soul. 

To fluff out her curls, put on fashionable 
dresses, and sing romantic songs to fascinate 
her husband would have seemed as strange as 
to adorn herself to attract herself. To adorn 
herself for others might perhaps have been 
agreeable she did not know but she had no 
time at all for it. The chief reason for devoting 
no time either to singing, to dress, or to choos- 
ing her words was that she really had no time 
to spare for these things. 

We know that man has the faculty of becom- 
ing completely absorbed in a subject however 
trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so 
trivial that it will not grow to infinite propor- 
tions if one's entire attention is devoted to it. 

The subject which wholly engrossed Nata- 
sha's attention was her family: that is, her hus- 
band whom she had to keep so that he should 
belong entirely to her and to the home, and 
the children whom she had to bear, bring into 
the world, nurse, and bring up. 

And the deeper she penetrated, not with 
her mind only but with her whole soul, her 
whole being, into the subject that absorbed 
her, the larger did that subject grow and the 
weaker and more inadequate did her own pow- 
ers appear, so that she concentrated them whol- 
ly on that one thing and yet was unable to ac- 
complish all that she considered necessary. 

There were then as now conversations and 
discussions about women's rights, the relations 
of husband and wife and their freedom and 
rights, though these themes were not yet 
teamed questions as they are now; but these 
topics were not merely uninteresting to Na- 



FIRST EPILOGUE 



661 



tdsha, she positively did not understand them. 

These questions, then as now, existed only 
for those who see nothing in marriage but the 
pleasure married people get from one another, 
that is, only the beginnings of marriage and 
not its whole significance, which lies in the 
family. 

Discussions and questions of that kind, which 
are like the question of how to get the greatest 
gratification from one's dinner, did not then 
and do not now exist for those for whom the 
purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it af- 
fords; and the purpose of marriage is the fam- 
ily. 

If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the 
body, a man who eats two dinners at once 
may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not 
attain his purpose, for his stomach will not di- 
gest the two dinners. 

If the purpose of marriage is the family, the 
person who wishes to have many wives or hus- 
bands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but 
in that case will not have a family. 

If the purpose of food is nourishment and 
the purpose of marriage is the family, the whole 
question resolves itself into not eating more 
than one can digest, and not having more wives 
or husbands than are needed for the family 
that is, one wife or one husband. Natisha need- 
ed a husband. A husband was given her and he 
gave her a family. And she not only saw no 
need of any other or better husband, but as all 
the powers of her soul were intent on serving 
that husband and family, she could not imag- 
ine and saw no interest in imagining how it 
would be if things were different. 

Natasha did not care for society in general, 
but prized the more the society of her rela- 
tivesCountess Mary, and her brother, her 
mother, and S6nya. She valued the company 
of those to whom she could come striding di- 
sheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, 
and with joyful face show a yellow instead of 
a green stain on baby's napkin, and from whom 
she could hear reassuring words to the effect 
that baby was much better. 

To such an extent had Natasha let herself go 
that the way she dressed and did her hair, her 
ill-chosen words, and her jealousy she was 
jealouiof S6nya, of the governess, and of every 
woman, pretty or plain were habitual sub- 
jects of jest to those about her. The general 
opinion was that Pierre was under his wife's 
thumb, which was really true. From the very 
first days of their married life Natasha had an- 
nounced her demands. Pierre was greatly sur- 



prised by his wife's view, to him a perfectly 
novel one, that every moment of his life be- 
longed to her and to the family. His wife's de- 
mands astonished him, but they also flattered 
him, and he submitted to them. 

Pierre's subjection consisted in the fact that 
he not only dared not flirt with, but dared not 
even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did 
not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not 
dare spend money on a whim, and did not dare 
absent himself for any length of time, except 
on business in which his wife included his in- 
tellectual pursuits, which she did not in the 
least understand but to which she attributed 
great importance. To make up for this, at 
home Pierre had the right to regulate his life 
and that of the whole family exactly as he 
chose. At home Natdsha placed herself in the 
position of a slave to her husband, and the 
whole household went on tiptoe when he was 
occupied that is, was reading or writing in his 
study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for 
anything to get just what he liked done always. 
He had only to express a wish and Natasha 
would jump up and run to fulfill it. 

The entire household was governed accord- 
ing to Pierre's supposed orders, that is, by his 
wishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their 
way of life and place of residence, their ac- 
quaintances and ties, Natasha's occupations, 
the children's upbringing, were all selected not 
merely with regard to Pierre's expressed wishes, 
but to what Natasha from the thoughts he ex- 
pressed in conversation supposed his wishes to 
be. And she deduced the essentials of his wish- 
es quite correctly, and having once arrived at 
them clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre 
himself wanted to change his mind she would 
fight him with his own weapons. 

Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to 
him after the birth of their first child who was 
delicate, when they had to change the wet 
nurse three times and Natdsha fell ill from de- 
spair, Pierre one day told her of Rousseau's 
view, with which he quite agreed, that to have 
a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful. When 
her next baby was born, despite the opposi- 
tion of her mother, the doctors, and even of 
her husband himself who were all vigorously 
opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a 
thing then unheard of and considered injuri- 
ousshe insisted on having her own way, and 
after that nursed all her babies herself. 

It very often happened that in a moment of 
irritation husband and wife would have a dis- 
pute, but long afterwards Pierre to his sur- 



662 



WAR AND PEACE 



prise and delight would find in his wife's ideas 
and actions the very thought against which she 
had argued, but divested of everything super- 
fluous that in the excitement of the dispute he 
had added when expressing his opinion. 

After seven years of marriage Pierre had the 
joyous and firm consciousness that he was not 
a bad man, and he felt this because he saw 
himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good 
and bad within himself inextricably mingled 
and overlapping. But only what was really 
good in him was reflected in his wife, all that 
was not quite good was rejected. And this was 
not the result of logical reasoning but was a 
direct and mysterious reflection. 

CHAPTER XI 

Two MONTHS PREVIOUSLY when Pierre was al- 
ready staying with the Rost6vs he had received 
a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to 
come to Petersburg to confer on some impor- 
tant questions that were being discussed there 
by a society of which Pierre was one of the 
principal founders. 

On reading that letter (she always read her 
husband's letters) Natdsha herself suggested 
that he should go to Petersburg, though she 
would feel his absence very acutely. She at- 
tributed immense importance to all her hus- 
band's intellectual and abstract interests 
though she did not understand them, and she 
always dreaded being a hindrance to him in 
such matters. To Pierre's timid look of inquiry 
after reading the letter she replied by asking 
him to go, but to fix a definite date for his re- 
turn. He was given four weeks' leave of ab- 
sence. 

Ever since that leave of absence had expired, 
more than a fortnight before, Natasha had 
been in a constant state of alarm, depression, 
and irritability. 

Denisov, now a general on the retired list 
and much dissatisfied with the present state of 
affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He 
looked at Natasha with sorrow and surprise as 
at a bad likeness of a person once dear. A dull, 
dejected look, random replies, and talk about 
the nursery was all he saw and heard from his 
former enchantress. 

Natasha was sad and irritable all that time, 
especially when her mother, her brother, S6nya, 
or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her 
tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons 
for his delay in returning. 

"It's all nonsense, all rubbish those discus- 
sions which lead to nothing and all those idi- 



otic societies!" Natasha declared of the very af- 
fairs in the immense importance of which she 
firmly believed. 

And she would go to the nursery to nurse 
P6tya, her only boy. No one else could tell her 
anything so comforting or so reasonable as 
this little three-month-old creature when he 
lay at her breast and she was conscious of the 
movement of his lips and the snuffling of his 
little nose. That creature said: "You are angry, 
you are jealous, you would like to pay him 
out, you are afraidbut here am II And I am 
he . . ." and that was unanswerable. It was 
more than true. 

During that fortnight of anxiety Natasha 
resorted to the baby for comfort so often, and 
fussed over him so much, that she overfed him 
and he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, 
and yet that was just what she needed. While 
attending to him she bore the anxiety about 
her husband more easily. 

She was nursing her boy when the sound of 
Pierre's sleigh was heard at the front door, and 
the old nurse knowing how to please her mis- 
tressentered the room inaudibly but hurried- 
ly and with a beaming face. 

"Has he come?" Natdsha asked quickly in a 
whisper, afraid to move lest she should rouse 
the dozing baby. 

"He's come, ma'am," whispered the nurse. 

The blood rushed to Natdsha's face and her 
feet involuntarily moved, but she could not 
jump up and run out. The baby again opened 
his eyes and looked at her. "You're here?" he 
seemed to be saying, and again lazily smacked 
his lips. 

Cautiously withdrawing her breast, Natdsha 
rocked him a little, handed him to the nurse, 
and went with rapid steps toward the door. 
But at the door she stopped as if her conscience 
reproached her for having in her joy left the 
child too soon, and she glanced round. The 
nurse with raised elbows was lifting the in- 
fant over the rail of his cot. 

"Go, ma'aml Don't worry, go!" she whis- 
pered, smiling, with the kind of familiarity 
that grows up between a nurse and her mis- 
tress. 

Natdsha ran with light footsteps to the ante- 
room. 

Denfsov, who had come out of the study in- 
to the dancing room with his pipe, now for the 
first time recognized the old Natdsha. A flood 
of brilliant, joyful light poured from her trans- 
figured face. 

"He's come!" she exclaimed as she ran past, 



FIRST EPILOGUE 

and Denfsov felt that he too was delighted that 
Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had re- 
turned. 

On reaching the vestibule Natasha saw a tall 
figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf. "It's 
he! It's really hel He has come!" she said to 
herself, and rushing at him embraced him, 
pressed his head to her breast, and then pushed 
him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face, 
covered with hoarfrost. "Yes, it is he, happy 
and contented. . . ." 

Then all at once she remembered the tor- 
tures of suspense she had experienced for the 
last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her 
face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed 
Pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry 
words. 

"Yes, it's all very well for you. You are 
pleased, you've had a good time. . . . But what 
about me? You might at least have shown con- 
sideration for the children. I am nursing and 
my milk was spoiled. . . . Pckya was at death's 
door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, en- 
joying . . ." 

Pierre knew he was not to blame, for he 
could not have come sooner; he knew this out- 
burst was unseemly and would blow over in a 
minute or two; above all he knew that he him- 
self was bright and happy. He wanted to smile 
but dared not even think of doing so. He made 
a piteous, frightened face and bent down. 

"I could not, on my honor. But how is Pe*t- 
ya?" 

"All right now. Come along! I wonder you're 
not ashamed! If only you could see what I was 
like without you, how I suffered!" 

"You are well?" 

"Come, come!" she said, not letting go of his 
arm. And they went to their rooms. 

When Nicholas and his wife came to look for 
Pierre he was in the nursery holding his baby 
son, who was again awake, on his huge right 
palm and dandling him. A blissful bright smile 
was fixed on the baby's broad face with its 
toothless open mouth. The storm was long 
since over and there was bright, joyous sun- 
shine on Natasha's face as she gazed tenderly 
at her husband and child. 

"And have you talked everything well over 
with Prince Theodore?" she asked. 

"Yes, capitally." 

"You see, he holds it up." (She meant the 
baby's head.) "But how he did frighten me ... 
You've seen the princess? Is it true she's in love 
with that . . ." 

"Yes, just fancy . . ." 



663 

At that moment Nicholas and Countess 
Mary came in. Pierre with the baby on his 
hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to 
their inquiries. But in spite of much that was 
interesting and had to be discussed, the baby 
with the little cap on its unsteady head evi- 
dently absorbed all his attention. 

"How sweet!" said Countess Mary, looking 
at and playing with the baby. "Now, Nicholas," 
she added, turning to her husband, "I can't 
understand how it is you don't see the charm 
of these delicious marvels." 

"I don't and can't," replied Nicholas, look- 
ing coldly at the baby. "A lump of flesh. Come 
along, Pierre!" 

"And yet he's such an affectionate father," 
said Countess Mary, vindicating her husband, 
"but only after they are a year old or so . . ." 

"Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly," said 
Natasha. "He says his hand is just made for a 
baby's seat. Just look!" 

"Only not for this . . ." Pierre suddenly ex- 
claimed with a laugh, and shifting the baby 
he gave him to the nurse. 



CHAPTER XII 

As IN EVERY large household, there were at 
Bald Hills several perfectly distinct worlds 
which merged into one harmonious whole, 
though each retained its own peculiarities and 
made concessions to the others. Every event, 
joyful or sad, that took place in that house was 
important to all these worlds, but each had its 
own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over 
that occurrence independently of the others. 

For instance, Pierre's return was a joyful and 
important event and they all felt it to be so. 

The servants the most reliable judges of 
their masters because they judge not by their 
conversation or expressions of feeling but by 
their acts and way of life were glad of Pierre's 
return because they knew that when he was 
there Count Nicholas would cease going every 
day to attend to the estate, and would be in bet- 
ter spirits and temper, and also because they 
would all receive handsome presents for the 
holidays. 

The children and their governesses were 
glad of Pierre's return because no one else 
drew them into the social life of the household 
as he did. He alone could play on the clavichord 
that dcossaise (his only piece) to which, as he 
said, all possible dances could be danced, and 
they felt sure he had brought presents for them 
all. 

Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, 



664 



WAR AND PEACE 



delicate and intelligent, with curly light-brown 
hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because 
Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object 
of his rapturous and passionate affection. No 
one had instilled into him this love for Pierre 
whom he saw only occasionally. Countess 
Mary who had brought him up had done her 
utmost to make him love her husband as she 
loved him, and little Nicholas did love his un- 
cle, but loved him with just a shade of con- 
tempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not 
want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George 
like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learn- 
ed, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre's pres- 
ence his face always shone with pleasure and 
he flushed and was breathless when Pierre 
spoke to him. He did not miss a single word 
he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessal- 
les or by himself, recall and reconsider the 
meaningof everything Pierre had said. Pierre's 
past life and his unhappiness prior to 18 1 2 (of 
which young Nicholas had formed a vague po- 
etic picture from some words he had overheard), 
his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Plat6n 
Karataev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), 
his love for Natdsha (of whom the lad was also 
particularly fond), and especially Pierre's 
friendship with the father whom Nicholas 
could not remember all this made Pierre in 
his eyes a hero and a saint. 

From broken remarks about Natasha and his 
father, from the emotion with which Pierre 
spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, 
reverent tenderness with which Natdsha spoke 
of him, the boy, who was only just beginning 
to guess what love is, derived the notion that 
his father had loved Natdsha and when dying 
had left her to his friend. But the father whom 
the boy did not remember appeared to him a 
divinity who could not be pictured, and of 
whom he never thought without a swelling 
heart and tears of sadness and rapture. So the 
boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived. 

The guests welcomed Pierre because he al- 
ways helped to enliven and unite any company 
he was in. 

The grown-up members of the family, not 
to mention his wife, were pleased to have back 
a friend whose presence made life run more 
smoothly and peacefully. 

The old ladies were pleased with the pres- 
ents he brought them, and especially that Na- 
tdsha would now be herself again. 

Pierre felt the different outlooks of these 
various worlds and made haste to satisfy all 
their expectations. 



Though the most absent-minded and for- 
getful of men, Pierre, with the aid of a list his 
wife drew up, had now bought everything, not 
forgetting his mother-and brother-in-law's com- 
missions, nor the dress material for a present 
to Bel6va, nor toys for his wife's nephews. In 
the early days of his marriage it had seemed 
strange to him that his wife should expect him 
not to forget to procure all the things he under- 
took to buy, and he had been taken aback by 
her serious annoyance when on his first trip 
he forgot everything. But in time he grew used 
to this demand. Knowing that Natasha asked 
nothing for herself, and gave him commissions 
for others only when he himself had offered to 
undertake them, he now found an unexpected 
and childlike pleasure in this purchase of 
presents for everyone in the house, and never 
forgot anything. If he now incurred Natasha's 
censure it was only for buying too many and 
too expensive things. To her other defects (as 
most people thought them, but which to Pierre 
were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of 
herself, she now added stinginess. 

From the time that Pierre began life as a 
family man on a footing entailing heavy ex- 
penditure, he had noticed to his surprise that 
he spent only half as much as before, and that 
his affairs which had been in disorder of late, 
chiefly because of his first wife's debts had be- 
gun to improve. 

Life was cheaper because it was circum- 
scribed: that most expensive luxury, the kind 
of life that can be changed at any moment, was 
no longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt 
that his way of life had now been settled once 
for all till death and that to change it was not 
in his power, and so that way of life proved 
economical. 

With a merry, smiling face Pierre was sort- 
ing his purchases. 

"What do you think of this?" said he, un- 
rolling a piece of stuff like a shopman. 

Natasha, who was sitting opposite to him 
with her eldest daughter on her lap, turned 
her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband 
to the things he showed her. 

"That's for Bel6va? Excellentl" She felt the 
quality of the material. "It was a ruble an ar- 
shin, I suppose?" 

Pierre told her the price. 

"Too dear!" Natdsha remarked. "How 
pleased the children will be and Mamma too! 
Only you need not have bought me this," she 
added, unable to suppress a smile as she gazed 
admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls, of 



FIRST EPILOGUE 



a kind then just coming into fashion. 

"Adele tempted me: she kept on telling me 
to buy it," returned Pierre. 

"When am I to wear it?" and Natdsha stuck 
it in her coil of hair. "When I take little Mdsha 
into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable 
again by then. Well, let's go now." 

And collecting the presents they went first 
to the nursery and then to the old countess* 
rooms. 

The countess was sitting with her companion 
Bel6va, playing grand-patience as usual, when 
Pierre and Natdsha came into the drawing 
room with parcels under their arms. 

The countess was now over sixty, was quite 
gray, and wore a cap with a frill that sur- 
rounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her 
upper lip had sunk in, and her eyes were dim. 

After the deaths of her son and husband in 
such rapid succession, she felt herself a being 
accidentally forgotten in this world and left 
without aim or object for her existence. She 
ate, drank, slept, or kept awake, but did not 
live. Life gave her no new impressions. She 
wanted nothing from life but tranquillity, and 
that tranquillity only death could give her. 
But until death came she had to go on living, 
that is, to use her vital forces. A peculiarity 
one sees in very young children and very old 
people was particularly evident in her. Her life 
had no external aims only a need to exercise 
her various functions and inclinations was ap- 
parent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep, 
work, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely 
because she had a stomach, a brain, muscles, 
nerves, and a liver. She did these things not 
under any external impulse as people in the 
full vigor of life do, when behind the purpose 
for which they strive that of exercising their 
functions remains unnoticed. She talked only 
because she physically needed to exercise her 
tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does, be- 
cause her nose had to be cleared, and so on. 
What for people in their full vigor is an aim 
was for her evidently merely a pretext. 

Thus in the morning especially if she had 
eaten anything rich the day before she felt a 
need of being angry and would choose as the 
handiest pretext BekSva's deafness. 

She would begin to say something to her in 
a low tone from the other end of die room. 

"It seems a little warmer today, my dear," 
she would murmur. 

And when Bel6va replied: "Oh yes, they've 
come," she would mutter angrily: "O Lord! 
How stupid and deaf she is!" 



Another pretext would be her snuff, which 
would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed 
fine enough. After these fits of irritability her 
face would grow yellow, and her maids knew 
by infallible symptoms when Bel6va would 
again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the count- 
ess' face yellow. Just as she needed to work off 
her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her 
still-existing faculty of thinking and the pre- 
text for that was a game of patience. When she 
needed to cry, the deceased count would be 
the pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, 
Nicholas and his health would be the pretext, 
and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, 
the pretext would be Countess Mary. When 
her vocal organs needed exercise, which was 
usually toward seven o'clock when she had 
had an after-dinner rest in a darkened room, 
the pretext would be the retelling of the same 
stories over and over again to the same audi- 
ence. 

The old lady's condition was understood by 
the whole household though no one ever spoke 
of it, and they all made every possible effort 
to satisfy her needs. Only by a rare glance ex- 
changed with a sad smile between Nicholas, 
Pierre, Natdsha, and Countess Mary was the 
common understanding of her condition ex- 
pressed. 

But those glances expressed something 
more: they said that she had played her part 
in life, that what they now saw was not her 
whole self, that we must all become like her, 
and that they were glad to yield to her, to re- 
strain themselves for this once precious being 
formerly as full of life as themselves, but now 
so much to be pitied. "Memento mori" said 
these glances. 

Only the really heartless, the stupid ones of 
that household, and the little children failed 
to understand this and avoided her. 

CHAPTER XIII 

WHEN PIERRE and his wife entered thedrawing 
room the countess was in one of her customary 
states in which she needed the mental exertion 
of playing patience, and so though by force 
of habit she greeted him with the words she al- 
ways used when Pierre or her son returned aft- 
er an absence: "High time, my dear, high time! 
We were all weary of waiting for you. Well, 
thank God!" and received her presents with 
another customary remark: "It's not the gift 
that's precious, my dear, but that you give it 
to me, an old woman . . ."yet it was evident 
that she was not pleased by Pierre's arrival at 



666 



WAR AND PEACE 



that moment when it diverted her attention 
from the unfinished game. 

She finished her game of patience and only 
then examined the presents. They consisted 
of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a 
bright-blue Sevres tea cup with shepherdesses 
depicted on it and with a lid, and a gold snuff- 
box with the count's portrait on the lid which 
Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Pe- 
tersburg. The countess had long wished for 
such a box, but as she did not want to cry just 
then she glanced indifferently at the portrait 
and gave her attention chiefly to the box for 
cards. 

"Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me 
up/' said she as she always did. "But best of 
all you have brought yourself back for I never 
saw anything like it, you ought to give your 
wife a scolding! What are we to do with her? 
She is like a mad woman when you are away. 
Doesn't see anything, doesn't remember any- 
thing," she went on, repeating her usual 
phrases. "Look, Anna Timofevna,"she added 
to her companion, "see what a box for cards 
my son has brought usl" 

Belova admired the presents and was de- 
lighted with her dress material. 

Though Pierre, Natdsha, Nicholas, Countess 
Mary, and Denfsov had much to talk about 
that they could not discuss before the old 
countess not that anything was hidden from 
her, but because she had dropped so far be- 
hindhand in many things that had they begun 
to converse in her presence they would have 
had to answer inopportune questions and to 
repeat what they had already told her many 
times: that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so 
was married, which she would again be unable 
to remember yet they sat at tea round the 
samovar in the drawing room from habit, and 
Pierre answered the countess' questions as to 
whether Prince Vasili had aged and whether 
Countess Mary Alexdevna had sent greetings 
and still thought of them, arid other matters 
that interested no one and to which she herself 
was indifferent. 

Conversation of this kind, interesting to no 
one yet unavoidable, continued all through 
teatime. All the grown-up members of the fam- 
ily were assembled near the round tea table at 
which S6nya presided beside the samovar. The 
children with their tutors and governesses had 
had tea and their voices were audible from the 
next room. At tea all sat in their accustomed 
places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small ta- 
ble where his tea was handed to him; Milka,the 



old gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the first MU- 
ka), with a quite gray face and large black eyes 
that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on 
the armchair beside him; Denfsov, whose curly 
hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half 
gray, sa t beside Coun tess Mary wi th his general's 
tunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife 
and the old countess. He spoke of what heknew 
might interest the old lady and that she could 
understand. He told her of external social 
events and of the people who had formed the 
circle of her contemporaries and had once been 
a real, living, and distinct group, but who were 
now for the most part scattered about the world 
and like herself were garnering the last ears of 
the harvests they had sown in earlier years. But 
to the old countess those contemporaries of 
hers seemed to be the only serious and real so- 
ciety. Natasha saw by Pierre's animation that 
his visit had been interesting and that he had 
much to tell them but dare not say it before 
the old countess. Denisov, not being a member 
of the family, did not understand Pierre's cau- 
tion and being, as a malcontent, much inter- 
ested in what was occurring in Petersburg, 
kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had 
happened in the Semenovsk regiment, then 
about Arakchdev, and then about the Bible 
Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away 
and began to speak of these things, but Nicho- 
las and Natasha always brought him back to 
the health of Prince Ivdn and Countess Mary 
Alexdevna. 

"Well, and all this idiocy Gossner and Ta- 
twinova?" Denfsov asked. "Is that weally still 
going on?" 

"Going on?" Pierre exclaimed. "Why more 
than everl The Bible Society is the whole gov- 
ernment now!" 

"What is that, mon cher ami?" asked the 
countess, who had finished her tea and evident- 
ly needed a pretext for being angry after her 
meal. "What are you saying about the govern- 
ment? I don't understand." 

"Well, you know, Maman," Nicholas inter- 
posed, knowing how to translate things into 
his mother's language, "Prince Alexander Golf- 
tsyn has founded a society and in consequence 
has great influence, they say." 

"Arakche'ev and Golftsyn," incautiously re- 
marked Pierre, "are now the whole govern- 
ment! And what a government! They see trea- 
son everywhere and are afraid of everything." 

"Well, and how is Prince Alexander to 
blame? He is a most estimable man. I used to 
meet him at Mary Ant6novna's," said the 



FIRST EPILOGUE 

countess in an offended tone; and still more 
offended that they all remained silent, she 
went on: "Nowadays everyone finds fault. A 
Gospel Society! Well, and what harm is there 
in that?" and she rose (everybody else got up 
too) and with a severe expression sailed back 
to her table in the sitting room. 

The melancholy silence that followed was 
broken by the sounds of the children's voices 
and laughter from the next room. Evidently 
some jolly excitement was going on there. 

"Finished, finished!" little Natasha's gleeful 
yell rose above them all. 

Pierre exchanged glances with Countess 
Mary and Nicholas (Natasha he never lost 
sight of) and smiled happily. 

"That's delightful music!" said he. 

"It means that Anna Makarovna has finished 
her stocking," said Countess Mary. 

"Oh, I'll go and see," said Pierre, jumping 
up. "You know," he added, stopping at the 
door, "why I'm especially fond of that music? 
It is always the first thing that tells me all is 
well. When I was driving here today, the nearer 
I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As 
I entered the anteroom I heard Andnisha's 
peals of laughter and that meant that all was 
well." 

"I know! I know that feeling," said Nicho- 
las. "But I mustn't go there those stockings 
are to be a surprise for me." 

Pierre went to the children, and the shout- 
ing and laughter grew still louder. 

"Come, Anna Makdrovna," Pierre's voice 
was heard saying, "come here into the middle 
of the room and at the word of command, 'One, 
two/ and when I say 'three' . . . You stand here, 
and you in my arms well now! One, two! . . ." 
said Pierre, and a silence followed: "three!" 
and a rapturously breathless cry of children's 
voices filled the room. "Two, two!" they 
shouted. 

This meant two stockings, which by a secret 
process known only to herself Anna Makrov- 
na used to knit at the same time on the same 
needles, and which, when they were ready, she 
always triumphantly drew, one out of the oth- 
er, in the children's presence. 



667 



CHAPTER XIV 

SOON AFTER THIS the children came in to say 
good night. They kissed everyone, the tutors 
and governesses made their bows, and they 
went out. Only young Nicholas and his tutor 
remained. Dessalles whispered to the boy to 
come downstairs. 



"No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt 
to let me stay," replied Nicholas Bolkonski al- 
so in a whisper. 

"Ma tante, please let me stay," said he, go- 
ing up to his aunt. 

His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and 
ecstasy. Countess Mary glanced at him and 
turned to Pierre. 

"When you are here he can't tear himself 
away," she said. 

"I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur 
Dessalles. Good night!" said Pierre, giving his 
hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to 
young Nicholas with a smile. "You and I 
haven't seen anything of one another yet. . . . 
How like he is growing, Mary!" he added, ad- 
dressing Countess Mary. 

"Like my father?" asked the boy, flushing 
crimson and looking up at Pierre with bright, 
ecstatic eyes. 

Pierre nodded, and went on with what he 
had been saying when the children had inter- 
rupted. Countess Mary sat down doing wool- 
work; Natasha did not take her eyes off her 
husband. Nicholas and Dcnfsov rose, asked for 
their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea 
from Sonya who sat weary but resolute at the 
samovar and questioned Pierre. The curly- 
headed, delicate boy sat with shining eyes un- 
noticed in a corner, starting every now and 
then and muttering something to himself, and 
evidently experiencing a new and powerful 
emotion as he turned his curly head, with his 
thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, to- 
ward the place where Pierre sat. 

The conversation turned on the contempo- 
rary gossip about those in power, in which 
most people see the chief interest of home 
politics. Denfsov, dissatisfied with the govern- 
ment on account of his own disappointments 
in the service, heard with pleasure of the things 
done in Petersburg which seemed to him stu- 
pid, and made forcible and sharp comments 
on what Pierre told them. 

"One used to have to be a German now one 
must dance with Tatawinova and Madame 
Kwiidener, and wead Ecka'tshausen and the 
bwethwen. Oh, they should let that fine fellow 
Bonaparte lose he'd knock all this nonsense 
out of them! Fancy giving the command of the 
Semenov wegiment to a fellow like that 
Schwa'tz!" he cried. 

Nicholas, though free from Denfsov's readi- 
ness to find fault with everything, also thought 
that discussion of the government was a very 
serious and weighty matter, and the fact that 



668 



WAR AND PEACE 



A had been appointed Minister of This and 
B Governor General of That, and that the 
Emperor had said so-and-so and this minister 
so-and-so, seemed to him very important. And 
so he thought it necessary to take an interest 
in these things and to question Pierre. The 
questions put by these two kept the conversa- 
tion from changing its ordinary character of 
gossip about the higher government circles. 

But Natdsha, knowing all her husband's ways 
and ideas, saw that he had long been wishing 
but had been unable to divert the conversa- 
tion to another channel and express his own 
deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had 
gone to Petersburg to consult with his new 
friend Prince Theodore, and she helped him 
by asking how his affairs with Prince Theodore 
had gone. 

4 'What was it about?" asked Nicholas. 

"Always the same thing," said Pierre, look- 
ing round at his listeners. "Everybody sees that 
things are going so badly that they cannot be 
allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all 
decent men to counteract it as far as they can." 

"What can decent men do?" Nicholas in- 
quired, frowning slightly. "What can be done?" 

"Why, this . . ." 

"Come into my study," said Nicholas. 

Natdsha, who had long expected to be fetched 
to nurse her baby, now heard the nurse calling 
her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary 
followed her. The men went into the study 
and little Nicholas Bolk6nski followed them 
unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the 
writing table in a shady corner by the window. 

"Well, what would you do?" asked Denfsov. 

"Always some fantastic schemes," said Nich- 
olas. 

"Why this," began Pierre, not sitting down 
but pacing the room, sometimes stopping short, 
gesticulating, and lisping: "the position in 
Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look 
into anything. He has abandoned himself alto- 
gether to this mysticism" (Pierre could not 
tolerate mysticism in anyone now). "He seeks 
only for peace, and only these people sans foi 
ni loi * can give it him people who recklessly 
hack at and strangle everything Magnftski, 
Arakchev, and tutti quanti. . . . You will agree 
that if you did not look after your estates your- 
self but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher 
your steward was the more readily your object 
might be attained," he said to Nicholas. 

"Well, what does that lead up to?" said 
Nicholas. 

1 Without faith or law. 



"Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery 
in the law courts, in the army nothing but 
flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; 
the people are tortured, enlightenment is sup- 
pressed. All that is young and honest is crushed! 
Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Every- 
thing is strained to such a degree that it will 
certainly break," said Pierre (as those who 
examine the actions of any government have 
always said since governments began). "I told 
them just one thing in Petersburg." 

"Told whom?" 

"Well, you know whom," said Pierre, with a 
meaning glance from under his brows. "Prince 
Theodore and all those. To encourage culture 
and philanthropy is all very well of course. 
The aim is excellent but in the present cir- 
cumstances something else is needed." 

At that moment Nicholas noticed the pres- 
ence of his nephew. His face darkened and he 
went up to the boy. 

"Why are you here?" 

"Why? Let him be," said Pierre, taking Nich- 
olas by the arm and continuing. "That is not 
enough, I told them. Something else is needed. 
When you stand expecting the overstrained 
string to snap at any moment, when everyone 
is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as 
many as possible must join hands as closely as 
they can to withstand the general calamity. 
Everything that is young and strong is being 
enticed away and depraved. One is lured by 
women, another by honors, a third by ambi- 
tion or money, and they go over to that camp. 
No independent men, such as you or I, are left. 
What I say is widen the scope of our society, 
let the mot d'ordre be not virtue alone but in- 
dependence and action as well!" 

Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably 
pushed up an armchair, sat down in it, and 
listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and 
frowning more and more. 

"But action with what aim?" he cried. "And 
what position will you adopt toward the gov- 
ernment?" 

"Why, the position of assistants. The society 
need not be secret if the government allows it. 
Not merely is it not hostile to government, but 
it is a society of true conservatives a society of 
gentlemen in the full meaning of that word. 
It is only to prevent some Pugache*v or other 
from killing my children and yours,* and Arak- 
che*ev from sending me off to some Military 
Settlement. We join hands only for the public 

8 Pugachev was the Cossack leader of a great 
peasant rising in Catherine the Great's time. TR. 



FIRST EPILOGUE 



welfare and the general safety." 

"Yes, but it's a secret society and therefore a 
hostile and harmful o;ie which can only cause 
harm." 

"Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved 
Europe" (they did not then venture to sug- 
gest that Russia had saved Europe) "do any 
harm? The Tugendbund is an alliance of vir- 
tue: it is love, mutual help ... it is what Christ 
preached on the Cross." 

Natdsha, who had come in during the con- 
versation, looked joyfully at her husband. It 
was not what he was saying that pleased her 
that did not even interest her, for it seemed to 
her that it was all extremelysimpleand thatshe 
had known it a long time (it seemed so to her 
because she knew that it sprang from Pierre's 
whole soul), but it was his animated and en- 
thusiastic appearance that made her glad. 

The boy with the thin neck stretching out 
from the turn-down collar whom everyone 
had forgotten ga/ed at Pierre with even great- 
er and more rapturous joy. Every word of 
Pierre's burned into his heart, and with a 
nervous movement of his fingers he uncon- 
sciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens 
his hands came upon on his uncle's table. 

"It is not at all what you suppose; but that 
is what the German Tugendbund was, and what 
I am proposing." 

"No, my fwiendl The Tugendbund is all 
vewy well for the sausage eaters, but I don't 
understand it and can't even pwonounce it," 
interposed Denisov in a loud and resolute 
voice. "I agwee that evewything here is wotten 
and howwible, but the Tugendbund I don't 
understand. If we're not satisfied, let us have a 
bunt of our own. 1 That's all wight. Je suis vot'e 
homme!" * 

Pierre smiled, Natdsha began to laugh, but 
Nicholas knitted his brows still more and be- 
gan proving to Pierre that there was no pros- 
pect of any great change and that all the dan- 
ger he spoke of existed only in his imagina- 
tion. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as 
his mental faculties were greater and more re- 
sourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This 
made him still angrier, for he was fully con- 
vinced, not by reasoning but by something 
within him stronger than reason, of the justice 
of his opinion. 

"I will tell you this," he said, rising and try- 

1 Denisov makes play with the similarity of the 
German word Bund, a union, and the Russian 
word bunt, a riot. TR. 

1 "I'm your man." 



ing with nervously twitching fingers to prop 
up his pipe in a corner, but finally abandon- 
ing the attempt. "I can't prove it to you. You 
say that everything here is rotten and that an 
overthrow is coming: I don't see it. But you 
also say that our oath of allegiance is a condi- 
tional matter, and to that I reply: 'You are 
my best friend, as you know, but if you formed 
a secret society and began working against the 
government be it what it may I know it is 
my duty to obey the government. And if Arak- 
chdev ordered me to lead a squadron against 
you and cut you down, I should not hesitate 
an instant, but should do it.' And you may ar- 
gue about that as you like!" 

An awkward silence followed these words. 
Natdsha was the first to speak, defending her 
husband and attacking her brother. Her de- 
fense was weak and inapt but she attained her 
object. The conversation was resumed, and no 
longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of 
Nicholas* last remark. 

When they all got up to go in to supper, lit- 
tle Nicholas Bolkonski went up to Pierre, pale 
and with shining, radiant eyes. 

"Uncle Pierre, you ... no ... If Papa were 
alive . . . would he agree with you?" he asked. 

And Pierre suddenly realized what a special, 
independent, complex, and powerful process 
of thought and feeling must have been going 
on in this boy during that conversation, and 
remembering all he had said he regretted that 
the lad should have heard him. He had, how- 
ever, to give him an answer. 

"Yes, I think so," he said reluctantly, and 
left the study. 

The lad looked down and seemed now for 
the first time to notice what he had done to the 
things on the table. He flushed and went up 
to Nicholas. 

"Uncle, forgive me, I did that . . . uninten- 
tionally," he said, pointing to the broken seal- 
ing wax and pens. 

Nicholas started angrily. 

"All right, all right," he said, throwing the 
bits under the table. 

And evidently suppressing his vexation with 
difficulty, he turned away from the boy. 

"You ought not to have been here at all," he 
said. 

CHAPTER XV 

THE CONVERSATION at supper was not about 
politics or societies, but turned on the subject 
Nicholas liked best recollections of 1819. 
Denfsov started these and Pierre was particu- 



670 

larly agreeable and amusing about them. The 
family separated on the most friendly terms. 

After supper Nicholas, having undressed in 
his study and given instructions to the steward 
who had been waiting for him, went to the 
bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found 
his wife still at her table, writing. 

"What are you writing, Mary?" Nicholas 
asked. 

Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that 
what she was writing would not be understood 
or approved by her husband. 

She had wanted to conceal what she was 
writing from him, but at the same time was 
glad he had surprised her at it and that she 
would now have to tell him. 

"A diary, Nicholas," she replied, handing 
him a blue exercise book filled with her firm, 
bold writing. 

"A diary?" Nicholas repeated with a shade 
of irony, and he took up the book. 

It was in French. 

December 4. Today when AndnVsha (her eldest 
lx&gt;y) woke up he did not wish to dress and Ma- 
demoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty 
and obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew 
angrier. Then I took the matter in hand: I left 
him alone and began with nurse's help to get the 
other children up, telling him that I did not love 
him. For a longtime he was silent. as if astonished, 
then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in his shirt, 
and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long 
time. It was plain that what troubled him most 
was that he had grieved me. Afterwards in the 
evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began 
crying piteously and kissing me. One can do any- 
thing with him by tenderness. 

"What is a 'ticket'?" Nicholas inquired. 

"I have begun giving the elder ones marks 
every evening, showing how they have be- 
haved." 

Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that 
were gazing at him, and continued to turn over 
the pages and read. In the diary was set down 
everything in the children's lives that seemed 
noteworthy to their mother as showing their 
characters or suggesting general reflections on 
educational methods. They were for the most 
part quite insignificant trifles, but did not seem 
so to the mother or to the father either, now 
that he read this diary about his children for 
the first time. 

Under the date "5" was entered: 

Mitya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to 
have no pudding. He had none, but looked so un- 
happily and greedily at the others while they were 



WAR AND PEACE 



eating! I think that punishment by depriving chil- 
dren o sweets only develops their greediness. Must 
tell Nicholas this. 

Nicholas put down the book and looked at 
his wife. The radiant eyes gazed at him ques- 
tioningly: would he approve or disapprove of 
her diary? There could be no doubt not only 
of his approval but also of his admiration for 
his wife. 

Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, 
thought Nicholas, or even done at all, but this 
untiring, continual spiritual effort of which 
the sole aim was the children's moral welfare 
delighted him. Had Nicholas been able to ana- 
lyze his feelings he would have found that his 
steady, tender, and proud love of his wife rested 
on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and 
at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his 
reach, in which she had her being. 

He was proud of her intelligence and good- 
ness, recognized his own insignificance beside 
her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the 
more that she with such a soul not only be- 
longed to him but was part of himself. 

"I quite, quite approve, my dearest!" said 
he with a significant look, and after a short 
pause he added: "And I behaved badly today. 
You weren't in the study. We began disputing 
Pierre and I and I lost my temper. But he is 
impossible: such a child! I don't know what 
would become of him if Natasha didn't keep 
him in hand. . . . Have you any idea why he 
went to Petersburg? They have formed . . ." 

"Yes, I know," said Countess Mary. "Nat- 
sha told me." 

"Well, then, you know," Nicholas went on, 
growing hot at the mere recollection of their 
discussion, "he wanted to convince me that it 
is every honest man's duty to go against the 
government, and that the oath of allegiance 
and duty ... I am sorry you weren't there. 
They all fell on me Denfsov and Natasha . . . 
Natasha is absurd. How she rules over him! 
And yet there need only be a discussion and 
she has no words of her own but only repeats 
his sayings . . ." added Nicholas, yielding to 
that irresistible inclination which tempts us to 
judge those nearest and dearest to us. He forgot 
that what he was saying about Natdsha could 
have been applied word for word to himself in 
relation to his wife. 

"Yes, I have noticed that," said Countess 
Mary. 

"When I told him that duty and the oath 
were above everything, he started proving 
goodness knows what! A pity you were not

there what would you have said?" 

"As I see it you were quite right, and I told 
Natasha so. Pierre says everybody is suffering, 
tortured, and being corrupted, and that it is 
our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is 
right there," said Countess Mary, "but he for- 
gets that we have other duties nearer to us, 
duties indicated to us by God Himself, and 
that though we might expose ourselves to risks 
we must not risk our children." 

"Yes, that's itl That's just what I said to 
him," put in Nicholas, who fancied he really 
had said it. "But they insisted on their own 
view: love of one's neighbor and Christianity 
and all this in the presence of young Nich- 
olas, who had gone into my study and broke 
all my things." 

"Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often 
troubled about little Nicholas," said Countess 
Mary. "He is such an exceptional boy. I am 
afraid I neglect him in favor of my own: we 
all have children and relations while he has no 
one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts." 

"Well, I don't think you need reproach 
yourself on his account. All that the fondest 
mother could do for her son you have done 
and are doing for him, and of course I am glad 
of it. He is a fine lad, a fine ladl This evening 
he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and 
fancy as we were going in to supper I looked 
and he had broken everything on my table to 
bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I 
never knew him to tell an untruth. A fine lad, 
a fine ladl" repeated Nicholas, who at heart 
was not fond of Nicholas Bolk6nski but was 
always anxious to recognize that he was a fine 
lad. 

"Still, I am not the same as his own mother," 
said Countess Mary. "I feel I am not the same 
and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am 
dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for 
him to have companions." 

"Well it won't be for long. Next summer I'll 
take him to Petersburg," said Nicholas. "Yes, 
Pierre always was a dreamer and always will 
be," he continued, returning to the talk in the 
study which had evidently disturbed him. 
"Well, what business is it of mine what goes on 
therewhether Arakche'ev is bad, and all that? 
What business was it of mine when I married 
and was so deep in debt that I was threatened 
with prison, and had a mother who could not 
see or understand it? And then there are you 
and the children and our affairs. Is it for my 
own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the 
office from morning to night? No, but I know 



I must work to comfort my mother, to repay 
you, and not to leave the children such beggars 
as I was." 

Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man 
does not live by bread alone and that he at- 
tached too much importance to these matters. 
But she knew she must not say this and that it 
would be useless to do so. She only took his 
hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of ap- 
proval and a confirmation of his thoughts, and 
after a few minutes' reflection continued to 
think aloud. 

"You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofinych" 
(this was his overseer) "came back from the 
Tamb6v estate and told me they are already 
offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest." 

And with an eager face Nicholas began to 
speak of the possibility of repurchasing Otrad- 
noe before long, and added: "Another ten 
years of life and I shall leave the children . . . 
in an excellent position." 

Countess Mary listened to her husband and 
understood all that he told her. She knew that 
when he thought aloud in this way he would 
sometimes ask her what he had been saying, 
and be vexed if he noticed that she had been 
thinking about something else. But she had to 
force herself to attend, for what he was saying 
did not interest her at all. She looked at him 
and did not think, but felt, about something 
different. She felt a submissive tender love for 
this man who would never understand all that 
she understood, and this seemed to make her 
love for him still stronger and added a touch 
of passionate tenderness. Besides this feeling 
which absorbed her altogether and hindered 
her from following the details of her husband's 
plans, thoughts that had no connection with 
what he was saying flitted through her mind. 
She thought of her nephew. Her husband's ac- 
count of the boy's agitation while Pierre was 
speaking struck her forcibly, and various traits 
of his gentle, sensitive character recurred to 
her mind; and while thinking of her nephew 
she thought also of her own Children. She did 
not compare them with him, but compared 
her feeling for them with her feeling for him, 
and felt with regret that there was something 
lacking in her feeling for young Nicholas. 

Sometimes it seemed to her that this differ- 
ence arose from the difference in their ages, 
but she felt herself to blame toward him and 
promised in her heart to do better and to ac- 
complish the impossible in this life to love 
her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and 
all her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. 



67* 

Countess Mary's soul always strove toward the 
infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and 
could therefore never be at peace. A stern ex- 
pression of the lofty, secret suffering of a soul 
burdened by the, body appeared on her face. 
Nicholas gazed a* her. "O God! What will be- 
come of us if she dies, as I always fear when 
her face is like that?" thought he, and placing 
himself before the icon he began to say his 
evening prayers. 

CHAPTER XVI 

NATASHA AND PIERRE, left alone, also began to 
talk as only a husband and wife can talk, that 
is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity, 
understanding and expressing each other's 
thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic, 
without premises, deductions, or conclusions, 
and in a quite peculiar way. Natasha was so 
used to this kind of talk with her husband that 
for her it was the surest sign of something be- 
ing wrong between them if Pierre followed a 
line of logical reasoning. When he began prov- 
ing anything, or talking argumentatively and 
calmly and she, led on by his example, began 
to do the same, she knew that they were on the 
verge of a quarrel. 

From the moment they were alone and Na- 
tdsha came up to him with wide-open happy 
eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to 
her bosom, saying: "Now you are all mine, 
mine! You won't escape! "from that moment 
this conversation began, contrary to all the 
laws of logic and contrary to them because 
quite different subjects were talked about at 
one and the same time. This simultaneous dis- 
cussion of many topics did not prevent a clear 
understanding but on the contrary was the 
surest sign that they fully understood one an- 
other. 

Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, un- 
reasoning, and contradictory, except the feel- 
ing that guides the dream, so in this inter- 
course contrary to all laws of reason, the words 
themselves were not consecutive and clear but 
only the feeling that prompted them. 

Natasha spoke to Pierre about her brother's 
life and doings, of how she had suffered and 
lacked life during his own absence, and of how 
she was fonder than ever of Mary, and how 
Mary was in every way better than herself. In 
saying this Natdsha was sincere in acknowl- 
edging Mary's superiority, but at the same time 
by saying it she made a demand on Pierre that 
he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and 
to all other women, and that now, especially 



WAR AND PEACE 

after having seen many women in Petersburg, 
he should tell her so afresh. 

Pierre, answering Natasha's words, told her 
how intolerable it had been for him to meet 
ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg. 

"I have quite lost the knack of talking to 
ladies," he said. "It was simply dull. Besides, I 
was very busy." 

Natdsha looked intently at him and went 
on: 

"Mary is so splendid," she said. "How she 
understands children! It is as if she saw straight 
into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, Mitya 
was naughty ..." 

"How like his father he is," Pierre inter- 
jected. 

Natasha knew why he mentioned Mitya's 
likeness to Nicholas: the recollection of his dis- 
pute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant 
and he wanted to know what Natdsha thought 
of it. 

"Nicholas has the weakness of never agree- 
ing with anything not generally accepted. But 
I understand that you value what opens up a 
fresh line," said she, repeating words Pierre 
had once uttered. 

"No, the chief point is that to Nicholas 
ideas and discussions are an amusemental- 
most a pastime," said Pierre. "For instance, he 
is collecting a library and has made it a rule 
not to buy a new book till he has read what he 
had already bought Sismondi and Rousseau 
and Montesquieu," he added with a smile. 
"You know how much I ..." he began to soften 
down what he had said; but Natdsha inter- 
rupted him to show that this was unnecessary. 

"So you say ideas are an amusement to 
him. . . ." 

"Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. AH 
the time in Petersburg I saw everyone as in a 
dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all 
else is mere amusement." 

"Ah, I'm so sorry I wasn't there when you 
met the children," said Natdsha. "Which was 
most delighted? Lisa, I'm sure." 

"Yes," Pierre replied, and went on with 
what was in his mind. "Nicholas says we ought 
not to think. But I can't help it. Besides, when 
I was in Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) 
that the whole affair would go to pieces with- 
out meeveryone was pulling his own way. 
But I succeeded in uniting them all; and then 
my idea is so clear and simple. You see, I don't 
say that we ought to oppose this and that. We 
may be mistaken. What I say is: 'Join hands, 
you who love the right, and let there be but

673 



one banner that of active virtue/ Prince Ser- 
gy is a fine fellow and clever." 

Natasha would have had no doubt as to the 
greatness of Pierre's idea, but one thing dis- 
concerted her. "Can a man so important and 
necessary to society be also my husband? How 
did this happen?" She wished to express this 
doubt to him. "Now who could decide whether 
he is really cleverer than all the others?" she 
asked herself, and passed in review all those 
whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what 
he had said there was no one he had respected 
so highly as Plat6n Karataev. 

"Do you know what I am thinking about?" 
she asked. "About Plat6n Karataev. Would he 
have approved of you now, do you think?" 

Pierre was not at all surprised at this ques- 
tion. He understood his wife's line of thought. 

"Plat6n Karatdev?" he repeated, and pon- 
dered, evidently sincerely trying to imagine 
Karatiev's opinion on the subject. "He would 
not have understood . . .yet perhaps he would." 

"I love you awfully!" Natdsha suddenly said. 
"Awfully, awfully!" 

"No, he would not have approved," said 
Pierre, after reflection. "What he would have 
approved of is our family life. He was always 
so anxious to find seemliness, happiness, and 
peace in everything, and I should have been 
proud to let him see us. There nowyou talk 
of my absence, but you wouldn't believe what 
a special feeling I have for you after a separa- 
tion. . . ." 

"Yes, I should think . . ." Natasha began. 

"No, it's not that. I never leave off loving 
you. And one couldn't love more, but this is 
something special. . . . Yes, of course" he did 
not finish because their eyes meeting said the 
rest. 

"What nonsense it is," Natdsha suddenly ex- 
claimed, "about honeymoons, and that the 
greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, 
now is the best of all. If only you did not go 
away! Do you remember how we quarreled? 
And it was always my fault. Always mine. And 
what we quarreled about I don't even remem- 
ber!" 

"Always about the same thing," said Pierre 
with a smile. "Jealo . . ." 

"Don't say it! I can't bear it!" Natdsha cried, 
and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively. 
"Did you see her?" she added, after a pause. 

"No, and if I had I shouldn't have recog- 
nized her." 

They were silent for a while. 

"Oh, do you know? While you were talking 



in the study I was looking at you," Natdsha 
began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud 
that had come over them. "You are as like him 
as two peas like the boy." (She meant her lit- 
tle son.) "Oh, it's time to go to him. . . . The 
milk's come. . . . But I'm sorry to leave you." 

They were silent for a few seconds. Then 
suddenly turning to one another at the same 
time they both began to speak. Pierre began 
with self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natasha 
with a quiet, happy smile. Having interrupted 
one another they both stopped to let the other 
continue. 

"No. What did you say? Go on, go on." 

"No, you go on, I was talking nonsense," 
said Natasha. 

Pierre finished what he had begun. It was 
the sequel to his complacent reflections on his 
success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed 
to him that he was chosen to give a new direc- 
tion to the whole of Russian society and to the 
whole world. 

"I only wished to say that ideas that have 
great results are always simple ones. My whole 
idea is that if vicious people are united and 
constitute a power, then honest folk must do 
the same. Now that's simple enough." 

"Yes." 

"And what were you going to say?" 

"I? Only nonsense." 

"But all the same?" 

"Oh nothing, only a trifle," said Natdsha, 
smiling still more brightly. "I only wanted to 
tell you about Ptya: today nurse was coming 
to take him from me, and he laughed, shut his 
eyes, and clung to me. I'm sure he thought he 
was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now he's 
crying. Well, good-by!" and she left the room. 

Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas 
Bolk6nski's bedroom a little lamp was burn- 
ing as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark 
and they could not cure him of it.) Dessalles 
slept propped up on four pillows and his 
Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snor- 
ing. Little Nicholas, who had just waked up in 
a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed be- 
fore him with wide-open eyes. He had awaked 
from a terrible dream. He had dreamed that 
he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as 
were depicted in his Plutarch, were leading a 
huge army. The army was made up of white 
slanting lines that filled the air like the cob- 
webs that float about in autumn and which 
Dessalles called Ics fils dc la Vitrgc. In front 
was Glory, which was similar to those threads 



674 



WAR AND PEACE 



but rather thicker. He and Pierre were borne 
along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer 
to their goal. Suddenly the threads that moved 
them began to slacken and become entangled 
and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nich- 
olas stood before them in a stern and threaten- 
ing attitude. 

"Have you done this?" he said, pointing to 
some broken sealing wax and pens. "I loved 
you, but I have orders from Arakche*ev and 
will kill the first of you who moves forward." 
Little Nicholas turned to look at Pierre but 
Pierre was no longer there. In his place was 
his father Prince Andrew and his father had 
neither shape nor form, but he existed, and 
when little Nicholas perceived him he grew 
faint with love: he felt himself powerless, limp, 
and formless. His father caressed and pitied 
him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and 
nearer to them. Terror seized young Nicholas 
and he awoke. 

"My father!" he thought. (Though there 
were two good portraits of Prince Andrew in 
the house, Nicholas never imagined him in hu- 



man form.) "My father has been with me and 
caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle 
Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. 
Mucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should 
not the same sort of thing happen to me? I 
know they want me to learn. And I will learn, 
But someday I shall have finished learning, 
and then I will do something. I only pray God 
that something may happen to me such as hap- 
pened to Plutarch's men, and I will act as they 
did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, 
love me, and be delighted with me!" And sud- 
denly his bosom heaved with sobs and he be- 
gan to cry. 

"Are you ill?" he heard Dessalles' voice ask- 
ing. 

"No," answered Nicholas, and lay back on 
his pillow. 

"He is good and kind and I am fond of 
him!" he thought of Dessalles. "But Uncle 
Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And 
my father? Oh, Father, Father! Yes, 1 will do 
something with which even he would be satis- 
fied. . . ." 



Second Epilogue 



CHAPTER I 

HISTORY is the life of nations and of humanity. 
To seize and put into words, to describe di- 
rectly the life of humanity or even of a single 
nation, appears impossible. 

The ancient historians all employed one 
and the same method to describe and seize 
the apparently elusivethe life of a people. 
They described the activity of individuals who 
ruled the people, and regarded the activity 
of those men as representing the activity of the 
whole nation. 

The question: how did individuals make na- 
tions act as they wished and by what was the 
will of these individuals themselves guided? the 
ancients met by recognizing a divinity which 
subjected the nations to the will of a chosen 
man, and guided the will of that chosen man so 
as to accomplish ends that were predestined. 

For the ancients these questions were solved 
by a belief in the direct participation of the 
Deity in human affairs. 

Modern history, in theory, rejects both these 
principles. 

It would seem that having rejected the be- 
lief of the ancients in man's subjection to the 
Deity and in a predetermined aim toward 
which nations are led, modern history should 
study not the manifestations of power but the 
causes that produce it. But modern history 
has not done this. Having in theory rejected 
the view held by the ancients, it still follows 
them in practice. 

Instead of men endowed with divine author- 
ity and directly guided by the will of God, 
modern history has given us either heroes en- 
dowed with extraordinary, superhuman capac- 
ities, or simply men of very various kinds, from 
monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. 
Instead of the former divinely appointed aims 
of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which 
ancient historians regarded as representing the 
progress of humanity, modern history has 
postulated its own aims the welfare of the 
French, German, or English people, or, in its 



highest abstraction, the welfare and civiliza- 
tion of humanity in general, by which is usu- 
ally meant that of the peoples occupying a 
small northwesterly portion of a large con- 
tinent. 

Modern history has rejected the beliefs of 
the ancients without replacing them by a new 
conception, and the logic of the situation has 
obliged the historians, after they had appar- 
ently rejected the divine authority of the kings 
and the "fate" of the ancients, to reach the 
same conclusion by another road, that is, to 
recognize (i) nations guided by individual 
men, and (2) the existence of a known aim 
to which these nations and humanity at large 
are tending. 

At the basis of the works of all the modern 
historians from Gibbon to Buckle, despite 
their seeming disagreements and the appar- 
ent novelty of their outlooks, lie those two old, 
unavoidable assumptions. 

In the first place the historian describes the 
activity of individuals who in his opinion have 
directed humanity (one historian considers 
only monarchs, generals, and ministers as be- 
ing such men, while another includes also 
orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, 
and poets). Secondly, it is assumed that the 
goal toward which humanity is being led is 
known to the historians: to one of them this 
goal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish, 
or French realm; to another it is liberty, equal- 
ity, and a certain kind of civilization of a small 
corner of the world called Europe. 

In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, 
spreads, and is expressed by a movement of 
peoples from west to east. Several times it 
moves eastward and collides with a counter- 
movement from the east westward. In 18 is it 
reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, 
with remarkable symmetry, a countermove- 
ment occurs from east to west, attracting to it, 
as the first movement had done, the nations of 
middle Europe. The countermovement reaches 
the starting point of the first movement in the 



675

west Paris and subsides. 

During that twenty-year period an immense 
number of fields were left untilled, houses 
were burned, trade changed its direction, mil- 
lions of men migrated, were impoverished, or 
were enriched, and millions of Christian men 
professing the law of love of their fellows slew 
one another. 

What does all this mean? Why did it hap- 
pen? What made those people burn houses 
and slay their fellow men? What were the 
causes of these events? What force made men 
act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and 
most legitimate questions humanity asks it- 
self when it encounters the monuments and 
tradition of that period. 

For a reply to these questions the common 
sense of mankind turns to the science of his- 
tory, whose aim is to enable nations and hu- 
manity to know themselves. 

If history had retained the conception of 
the ancients it would have said that God, to 
reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon 
power and directed his will to the fulfillment 
of the divine ends, and that reply would have 
been clear and complete. One might believe 
or disbelieve in the divine significance of Na- 
poleon, but for anyone believing in it there 
would have been nothing unintelligible in the 
history of that period, nor would there have 
been any contradictions. 

But modern history cannot give that reply. 
Science does not admit the conception of the 
ancients as to the direct participation of the 
Deity in human affairs, and therefore history 
ought to give other answers. 

Modern history replying to these questions 
says: you want to know what this movement 
means, what caused it, and what force pro- 
duced these events? Then listen: 

"Louis XIV was a very proud and self- 
confident man; he had such and such mistresses 
and such and such ministers and he ruled 
France badly. His descendants were weak 
men and they too ruled France badly. And 
they had such and such favorites and such 
and such mistresses. Moreover, certain men 
wrote some books at that time. At the end of 
the eighteenth century there were a couple of 
dozen men in Paris who began to talk about 
all men being free and equal. This caused 
people all over France to begin to slash at and 
drown one another. They killed the king and 
many other people. At that time there was in 
France a man of genius Napoleon. He con- 
quered everybody everywhere that is, he 



WAR AND PEACE 



killed many people because he was a great 
genius. And for some reason he went to kill 
Africans, and killed them so well and was so 
cunning and wise that when he returned to 
France he ordered everybody to obey him, and 
they all obeyed him. Having become an Em- 
peror he again went out to kill people in Italy, 
Austria, and Prussia. And there too he killed a 
great many. In Russia there was an Emperor, 
Alexander, who decided to restore order in 
Europe and therefore fought against Napoleon. 
In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, 
but in 1811 they again quarreled and again 
began killing many people. Napoleon led six 
hundred thousand men into Russia and cap- 
tured Moscow; then he suddenly ran away 
from Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, 
helped by the advice of Stein and others, 
united Europe to arm against the disturber 
of its peace. All Napoleon's allies suddenly 
became his enemies and their forces advanced 
against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies 
defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Na- 
poleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island 
of Elba, not depriving him of the title of Em- 
peror and showing him every respect, though 
five years before and one year later they all 
regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. 
Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the 
laughingstock both of the French and the 
Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shed- 
ding tears before his Old Guards, renounced 
the throne and went into exile. Then the skill- 
ful statesmen and diplomatists (especially 
Talleyrand, who managed to sit down in a 
particular chair before anyone else and there- 
by extended the frontiers of France) talked 
in Vienna and by these conversations made 
the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the 
diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled 
and were on the point of again ordering their 
armies to kill one another, but just then Na- 
poleon arrived in France with a battalion, and 
the French, who had been hating him, immedi- 
ately all submitted to him. But the Allied 
monarchs were angry at this and went to fight 
the French once more. And they defeated the 
genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing 
him as a brigand, sent him to the island of St. 
Helena. And the exile, separated from the be- 
loved France so dear to his heart, died a lin- 
gering death on that rock and bequeathed his 
great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reac- 
tion occurred and the sovereigns once again 
all began to oppress their subjects." 
It would be a mistake to think that this is 



SECOND EPILOGUE 

ironic a caricature of the historical accounts. 
On the contrary it is a very mild expression of 
the contradictory replies, not meeting the 
questions, which all the historians give, from 
the compilers of memoirs and the histories of 
separate states to the writers of general his- 
tories and the new histories of the culture of 
that period. 

The strangeness and absurdity of these re- 
plies arise from the fact that modern history, 
like a deaf man, answers questions no one has 
asked. 

If the purpose of history be to give a descrip- 
tion of the movement of humanity and of the 
peoples, the first questionin the absence of 
a reply to which all the rest will be incom- 
prehensible is: what is the power that moves 
peoples? To this, modern history laboriously 
replies either that Napoleon was a great 
genius, or that Louis XIV was very proud, or 
that certain writers wrote certain books. 

All that may be so and mankind is ready to 
agree with it, but it is not what was asked. 
All that would be interesting if we recognized 
a divine power based on itself and always con- 
sistently directing its nations through Napo- 
leons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not 
acknowledge such a power, and therefore be- 
fore speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and 
authors, we ought to be shown the connection 
existing between these men and the movement 
of the nations. 

If instead of a divine power some other 
force has appeared, it should be explained in 
what this new force consists, for the whole in- 
terest of history lies precisely in that force. 

History seems to assume that this force is 
self-evident and known to everyone. But in 
spite of every desire to regard it as known, 
anyone reading many historical works cannot 
help doubting whether this new force, so vari- 
ously understood by the historians themselves, 
is really quite well known to everybody.

CHAPTER II 
WHAT FORCE moves the nations? 

Biographical historians and historians of 
separate nations understand this force as a 
power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their 
narration events occur solely by the will of a 
Napoleon, and Alexander, or in general of 
the persons they describe. The answers given 
by this kind of historian to the question of 
what force causes events to happen are satis- 
factory only as long as there is but one his- 
torian to each event. As soon as historians of 



different nationalities and tendencies begin to 
describe the same event, the replies they give 
immediately lose all meaning, for this force 
is understood by them all not only differently 
but often in quite contradictory ways. One 
historian says that an event was produced by 
Napoleon's power, another that it was pro- 
duced by Alexander's, a third that it was due 
to the power of some other person. Besides 
this, historians of that kind contradict each 
other even in their statement as to the force 
on which the authority of some particular per- 
son was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that 
Napoleon's power was based on his virtue and 
genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was 
based on his trickery and deception of the 
people. So the historians of this class, by mutu- 
ally destroying one another's positions, destroy 
the understanding of the force which produces 
events, and furnish no reply to history's essen- 
tial question. 

Writers of universal history who deal with 
all the nations seem to recognize how erro- 
neous is the specialist historians' view of the 
force which produces events. They do not 
recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and 
rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of 
variously directed forces. In describing a war 
or the subjugation of a people, a general his- 
torian looks for the cause of the event not in 
the power of one man, but in the interaction 
of many persons connected with the event. 

According to this view the power of histori- 
cal personages, represented as the product of 
many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be 
regarded as a force that itself produces events. 
Yet in most cases universal historians still em- 
ploy the conception of power as a force that 
itself produces events, and treat it as their 
cause. In their exposition, an historic char- 
acter is first the product of his time, and his 
power only the resultant of various forces, and 
then his power is itself a force producing 
events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for in- 
stance, at one time prove Napoleon to be a 
product of the Revolution, of the ideas of 
1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say 
that the campaign of 1812 and other things 
they do not like were simply the product of 
Napoleon's misdirected will, and that the very 
ideas of 1789 were arrested in their develop- 
ment by Napoleon's capricej The ideas of the 
Revolution and the general temper of the age 
produced Napoleon's power. But Napoleon's 
power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution 
and the general temper of the age.

WAR AND PEACE 



This curious contradiction is not accidental. 
Not only does it occur at every step, but the 
universal historians' accounts are all made up 
of a chain of such contradictions. This contra- 
diction occurs because after entering the field 
of analysis the universal historians stop half- 
way. 

To find component forces equal to the com- 
posite or resultant force, the sum of the com- 
ponents must equal the resultant. This condi- 
tion is never observed by the universal his- 
torians, and so to explain the resultant forces 
they are obliged to admit, in addition to the 
insufficient components, another unexplained 
force affecting the resultant action. 

Specialist historians describing the cam- 
paign of 1813 or the restoration of the Bour- 
bons plainly assert that these events were pro- 
duced by the will of Alexander. But the uni- 
versal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion 
of the specialist historian, tries to prove that 
the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of 
the Bourbons were due to other things beside 
Alexander's willsuch as the activity of Stein, 
Metternich, Madame de Stael, Talleyrand, 
Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The his- 
torian evidently decomposes Alexander's pow- 
er into the components: Talleyrand, Chateau- 
briand, and the rest but the sum of the com- 
ponents, that is, the interactions of Chateau- 
briand, Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and 
the others, evidently does not equal the result- 
ant, namely the phenomenon of millions of 
Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That 
Chateaubriand, Madame de Stael, and others 
spoke certain words to one another only affect- 
ed their mutual relations but does not account 
for the submission of millions. And therefore 
to explain how from these relations of theirs 
the submission of millions of people resulted 
that is, how component forces equal to one 
A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A 
the historian is again obliged to fall back on 
power the force he had denied and to rec- 
ognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, 
he has to admit an unexplained force acting 
on the resultant. And that is just what the 
universal historians do, and consequently they 
not only contradict the specialist historians 
but contradict themselves. 

Peasants having no clear idea of the cause 
of rain, say, according to whether they want 
rain or fine weather: "The wind has blown 
the clouds away," or, "The wind has brought 
up the clouds/' And in the same way the 
universal historians sometimes, when it pleases 



them and fits in with their theory, say that 
power is the result of events, and sometimes, 
when they want to prove something else, say 
that power produces events. 

A third class of historians the so-called his- 
torians of culturefollowing the path laid 
down by the universal historians who some- 
times accept writers and ladies as forces pro- 
ducing events again take that force to be 
something quite different. They see it in what 
is called culture in mental activity. 

The historians of culture are quite consist- 
ent in regard to their progenitors, the writers 
of universal histories, for if historical events 
may be explained by the fact that certain per- 
sons treated one another in such and such 
ways, why not explain them by the fact that 
such and such people wrote such and such 
books? Of the immense number of indications 
accompanying every vital phenomenon, these 
historians select the indication of intellectual 
activity and say that this indication is the cause. 
But despite their endeavors to prove that the 
cause of events lies in intellectual activity, 
only by a great stretch can one admit that 
there is any connection between intellectual 
activity and the movement of peoples, and in 
no case can one admit that intellectual activ- 
ity controls people's actions, for that view is 
not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel 
murders of the French Revolution resulting 
from the doctrine of the equality of man, or 
the very cruel wars and executions resulting 
from the preaching of love. 

But even admitting as correct all the cun- 
ningly devised arguments with which these 
histories are filled admitting that nations 
are governed by some undefined force called 
an idea history's essential question still re- 
mains unanswered, and to the former power of 
monarchs and to the influence of advisers and 
other people introduced by the universal his- 
torians, another, newer force the idea is 
added, the connection of which with the masses 
needs explanation. It is possible to understand 
that Napoleon had power and so events oc- 
curred; with some effort one may even con- 
ceive that Napoleon together with other in- 
fluences was the cause of an event; but how a 
book, Le Contrat social, had the effect of mak- 
ing Frenchmen begin to drown one another 
cannot be understood without an explana- 
tion of the causal nexus of this new force with 
the event. 

Undoubtedly some relation exists between 
all who live contemporaneously, and so it is 



SECOND EPILOGUE 



possible to find some connection between the 
intellectual activity of men and their histori- 
cal movements, just as such a connection may 
be found between the movements of human- 
ity and commerce, handicraft, gardening, or 
anything else you please. But why intellectual 
activity is considered by the historians of cul- 
ture to be the cause or expression of the whole 
historical movement is hard to understand. 
Only the following considerations can have 
led the historians to such a conclusion: (i) 
that history is written by learned men, and so 
it is natural and agreeable for them to think 
that the activity of their class supplies the 
basis of the movement of all humanity, just 
as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to 
traders, agriculturists, and soldiers (if they do 
not express it, that is merely because traders 
and soldiers do not write history), and (2) that 
spiritual activity, enlightenment, civilization, 
culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite con- 
ceptions under whose banner it is very easy to 
use words having a still less definite meaning, 
and which can therefore be readily introduced 
into any theory. 

But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of 
histories of this kind (which may possibly even 
be of use to someone for something) the his- 
tories of culture, to which all general histories 
tend more and more to approximate, are sig- 
nificant from the fact that after seriously and 
minutely examining various religious, philo- 
sophic, and political doctrines as causes of 
events, as soon as they have to describe an ac- 
tual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 
for instance, they involuntarily describe it as 
resulting from an exercise of powerand say 
plainly that that campaign was the result of 
Napoleon's will. Speaking so, the historians of 
culture involuntarily contradict themselves, 
and show that the new force they have devised 
does not account for what happens in history, 
and that history can only be explained by in- 
troducing a power which they apparently do 
not recognize. 

CHAPTER III 

A LOCOMOTIVE is moving. Someone asks: "What 
moves it?" A peasant says the devil moves it. 
Another man says the locomotive moves be- 
cause its wheels go round. A third asserts that 
the cause of its movement lies in the smoke 
which the wind carries away. 

The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised 
a complete explanation. To refute him some- 
one would have to prove to him that there is 



no devil, or another peasant would have to 
explain to him that it is not the devil but a 
German, who moves the locomotive. Only 
then, as a result of the contradiction, will they 
see that they are both wrong. But the man who 
says that the movement of the wheels is the 
cause refutes himself, for having once begun 
to analyze he ought to go on and explain 
further why the wheels go round; and till he 
has reached the ultimate cause of the move- 
ment of the locomotive in the pressure of 
steam in the boiler, he has no right to stop in 
his search for the cause. The man who explains 
the movement of the locomotive by the smoke 
that is carried back has noticed that the wheels 
do not supply an explanation and has taken 
the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn 
has offered that as an explanation. 

The only conception that can explain the 
movement of the locomotive is that of a force 
commensurate with the movement observed. 

The only conception that can explain the 
movement of the peoples is that of some force 
commensurate with the whole movement of 
the peoples. 

Yet to supply this conception various his- 
torians take forces of different kinds, all of 
which are incommensurate with the movement 
observed. Some see it as a force directly inher- 
ent in heroes, as the peasant sees the devil in 
the locomotive; others as a force resulting 
from several other forces, like the movement 
of the wheels; others again as an intellectual 
influence, like the smoke that is blown away. 

So long as histories are written of separate 
individuals, whether Caesars, Alexanders, 
Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories of 
all, absolutely all those who take part in an 
event, it is quite impossible to describe the 
movement of humanity without the concep- 
tion of a force compelling men to direct their 
activity toward a certain end. And the only 
such conception known to historians is that 
of power. 

This conception is the one handle by means 
of which the material of history, as at present 
expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone 
who breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, 
without finding some other method of treat- 
ing historical material, merely deprives him- 
self of the one possible way of dealing with it. 
The necessity of the conception of power as 
an explanation of historical events is best dem- 
onstrated by the universal historians and his- 
torians of culture themselves, for they pro- 
fessedly reject that conception but inevitably 



68o 



WAR AND PEACE 



have recourse to it at every step. 

In dealing with humanity's inquiry, the 
science of history up to now is like money in 
circulation paper money and coin. The bi- 
ographies and special national histories are 
like paper money. They can be used and can 
circulate and fulfill their purpose without 
harm to anyone and even advantageously, as 
long as no one asks what is the security behind 
them. You need only forget to ask how the 
will of heroes produces events, and such his- 
tories as Thiers' will be interesting and in- 
structive and may perhaps even possess a tinge 
of poetry. But just as doubts of the real value 
of paper money arise either because, being 
easy to make, too much of it gets made or be- 
cause people try to exchange it for gold, so 
also doubts concerning the real value of such 
histories arise either because too many of 
them are written or because in his simplicity 
of heart someone inquires: by what force did 
Napoleon do this?that is, wants to exchange 
the current paper money for the real gold of 
actual comprehension. 

The writers of universal histories and of the 
history of culture are like people who, recog- 
nizing the defects of paper money, decide to 
substitute for it money made of metal that 
has not the specific gravity of gold. It may in- 
deed make jingling coin, but will do no more 
than that. Paper money may deceive the ignor- 
ant, but nobody is deceived by tokens of base 
metal that have no value but merely jingle. 
As gold is gold only if it is serviceable not 
merely for exchange but also for use, so uni- 
versal historians will be valuable only when 
they can reply to history's essential question: 
what is power? The universal historians give 
contradictory replies to that question, while 
the historians of culture evade it and answer 
something quite different. And as counters of 
imitation gold can be used only among a 
group of people who agree to accept them as 
gold, or among those who do not know the 
nature of gold, so universal historians and 
historians of culture, not answering human- 
ity's essential question, serve as currency for 
some purposes of their own, only in univer- 
sities and among the mass of readers who have 
a taste for what they call "serious reading." 

CHAPTER IV 

HAVING ABANDONED the conception of the an- 
cients as to the divine subjection of the will of 
a nation to some chosen man and the subjec- 
tion of that man's will to the Deity, history 



cannot without contradictions take a single 
step till it has chosen one of two things: either 
a return to the former belief in the direct in- 
tervention of the Deity in human affairs or a 
definite explanation of the meaning of the 
force producing historical events and termed 
"power." 

A return to the first is impossible, the belief 
has been destroyed; and so it is essential to 
explain what is meant by power. 

Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and 
go to war. We are so accustomed to that idea 
and have become so used to it that the ques- 
tion: why did six hundred thousand men go 
to fight when Napoleon uttered certain words, 
seems to us senseless. He had the power and 
so what he ordered was done. 

This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe 
that the power was given him by God. But as 
soon as we do not admit that, it becomes es- 
sential to determine what is this power of one 
man over others. 

It cannot be the direct physical power o a 
strong man over a weak one a domination 
based on the application or threat of physical 
force, like the power of Hercules; nor can it 
be based on the effect of moral force, as in 
their simplicity some historians think who say 
that the leading figures in history are heroes, 
that is, men gifted with a special strength of 
soul and mind called genius. This power can- 
not be based on the predominance of moral 
strength, for, not to mention heroes such as 
Napoleon about whose moral qualities opin- 
ions differ widely, history shows us that neither 
a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over 
millions of people, had any particular moral 
qualities, but on the contrary were generally 
morally weaker than any of the millions they 
ruled over. 

If the source of power lies neither in the 
physical nor in the moral qualities of him who 
possesses it, it must evidently be looked for 
elsewhere in the relation to the people of 
the man who wields the power. 

And that is how power is understood by the 
science of jurisprudence, that exchange bank 
of history which offers to exchange history's 
understanding of power for true gold, 
j Power is the collective will of the people 
transferred, by expressed or tacit consent, to 
their chosen rulers. 

' In the domain of jurisprudence, which con- 
sists of discussions of how a state and power 
might be arranged were it possible for all that 
to be arranged, it is all very clear; but when 



SECOND EPILOGUE 



681 



applied to history that definition of power 
needs explanation. 

The science of jurisprudence regards the 
state and power as the ancients regarded fire- 
namely, as something existing absolutely. But 
for history, the state and power are merely 
phenomena, just as for modern physics fire is 
not an element but a phenomenon. 

From this fundamental difference between 
the view held by history and that held by ju- 
risprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can 
tell minutely how in its opinion power should 
be constituted and what power existing im- 
mutably outside time is, but to history's ques- 
tions about the meaning of the mutations of 
power in time it can answer nothing. 

If power be the collective will of the people 
transferred to their ruler, was Pugachev a rep- 
resentative of the will of the people? If not, 
then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon 
III a criminal when he was taken prisoner at 
Boulogne, and why, later on, were those crim- 
inals whom he arrested? 

Do palace revolutions in which sometimes 
only two or three people take part transfer 
the will of the people to a new ruler? In inter- 
national relations, is the will of the people also 
transferred to their conqueror? Was the will 
of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred 
to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Rus- 
sian people transferred to Napoleon in 1809, 
when our army in alliance with the French 
went to fight the Austrians? 

To these questions three answers are pos- 
sible: 

Either to assume (i) that the will of the 
people is always unconditionally transferred 
to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and 
that therefore every emergence of a new pow- 
er, every struggle against the power once ap- 
pointed, should be absolutely regarded as an 
infringement of the real power; or (2) that 
the will of the people is transferred to the 
rulers conditionally, under definiteand known 
conditions, and to show that all limitations, 
conflicts, and even destructions of power re- 
sult from a nonobservance by the rulers of the 
conditions under which their power was en- 
trusted to them; or (3) that the will of the 
people is delegated to the rulers conditionally, 
but that the conditions are unknown and in- 
definite, and that the appearance of several 
authorities, their struggles and their falls, re- 
sult solely from the greater or lesser fulfill- 
ment by the rulers of these unknown condi- 
tions on which the will of the people is trans- 



ferred from some people to others. 

And these are the three ways in which the 
historians do explain the relation of the peo- 
ple to their rulers. 

Some historians those biographical and 
specialist historians already referred to in 
their simplicity failing to understand the ques- 
tion of the meaning of power, seem to consider 
that the collective will of the people is uncon- 
ditionally transferred to historical persons, and 
therefore when describing some single state 
they assume that particular power to be the 
one absolute and real power, and that any 
other force opposing this is not a power but 
a violation of power mere violence. 

Their theory, suitable for primitive and 
peaceful periods of history, has the inconven- 
iencein application to complex and stormy 
periods in the life of nations during which 
various powers arise simultaneously and strug- 
gle with one another that a Legitimist his- 
torian will prove that the National Conven- 
tion, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere 
infringers of the true power, while a Republi- 
can and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that 
the Convention and the other that the Empire 
was the real power, and that all the others 
were violations of power. Evidently the ex- 
planations furnished by these historians being 
mutually contradictory can only satisfy young 
children. 

Recognizing the falsity of this view of his- 
tory, another set of historians say that power 
rests on a conditional delegation of the will 
of the people to their rulers, and that histori- 
cal leaders have power only conditionally on 
carrying out the program that the will of the 
people has by tacit agreement prescribed to 
them. But what this program consists in these 
historians do not say, or if they do they con- 
tinually contradict one another. 

Each historian, according to his view of 
what constitutes a nation's progress, looks for 
these conditions in the greatness, wealth, free- 
dom, or enlightenment of the citizens of France 
or some other country. But not to mention 
the historians' contradictions as to the nature 
of this program or even admitting that some 
one general program of these conditions exists 
the facts of history almost always contradict 
that theory. If the conditions under which 
power is entrusted consist in the wealth, free- 
dom, and enlightenment of the people, how 
is it that Louis XIV and Ivan the Terrible end 
their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and 
Charles I are executed by their people? To 



682 



WAR AND PEACE 



this question historians reply that Louis XIV's 
activity, contrary to the program, reacted on 
Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis 
XIV or on Louis XV why should it react just 
on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for 
such reactions? To these questions there are 
and can be no answers. Equally little does this 
view explain why for several centuries the 
collective will is not withdrawn from certain 
rulers and their heirs, and then suddenly dur- 
ing a period of fifty years is transferred to the 
Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to 
Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, 
to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republi- 
can government, and to Napoleon III. When 
explaining these rapid transfers of the people's 
will from one individual to another, especially 
in view of international relations, conquests, 
and alliances, the historians are obliged to 
admit that some of these transfers are not 
normal delegations of the people's will but are 
accidents dependent on cunning, on mistakes, 
on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, 
a ruler, or a party leader. So that the greater 
part of the events of history civil wars, revolu- 
tions, and conquests are presented by these 
historians not as the results of free transfer- 
ences of the people's will, but as results of the 
ill-directed will of one or more individuals, 
that is, once again, as usurpations of power. 
And so these historians also see and admit his- 
torical events which are exceptions to the 
theory. 

These historians resemble a botanist who, 
having noticed that some plants grow from 
seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist 
that all that grows does so by sprouting into 
two leaves, and that the palm, the mushroom, 
and even the oak, which blossom into full 
growth and no longer resemble two leaves, are 
deviations from the theory. 

Historians of the third class assume that the 
will of the people is transferred to historic per- 
sonages conditionally, but that the conditions 
are unknown to us. They say that historical 
personages have power only because they ful- 
fill the will of the people which has been dele- 
gated to them. 

But in that case, if the force that moves na- 
tions lies not in the historic leaders but in the 
nations themselves, what significance have those 
leaders? 

The leaders, these historians tell us, express 
the will of the people: the activity of the lead- 
ers represents the activity of the people. 

But in that case the question arises whether 



all the activity of the leaders serves as an ex- 
pression of the people's will or only some part 
of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves 
as the expression of the people's will, as some 
historians suppose, then all the details of the 
court scandals contained in the biographies 
of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express 
the life of the nation, which is evident non- 
sense; but if it is only some particular side of 
the activity of an historical leader which serves 
to express the people's life, as other so-called 
"philosophical" historians believe, then to de- 
termine which side of the activity of a leader 
expresses the nation's life, we have first of all 
to know in what the nation's life consists. 

Met by this difficulty historians of that class 
devise some most obscure, impalpable, and 
general abstraction which can cover all con- 
ceivable occurrences, and declare this abstrac- 
tion to be the aim of humanity's movement. 
The most usual generalizations adopted by al- 
most all the historians are: freedom, equality, 
enlightenment, progress, civilization, and cul- 
ture. Postulating some generalization as the 
goal of the movement of humanity, the his- 
torians study the men of whom the greatest 
number of monuments have remained: kings, 
ministers, generals, authors, reformers, popes, 
and journalists, to the extent to which in their 
opinion these persons have promoted or hin- 
dered that abstraction. But as it is in no way 
proved that the aim of humanity does consist 
in freedom, equality, enlightenment, or civil- 
ization, and as the connection of the people 
with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity 
is only based on the arbitrary assumption that 
the collective will of the people is always trans- 
ferred to the men whom we have noticed, it 
happens that the activity of the millions who 
migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture, 
and destroy one another never is expressed in 
the account of the activity of some dozen peo- 
ple who did not burn houses, practice agricul- 
ture, or slay their fellow creatures. 

History proves this at every turn. Is the fer- 
ment of the peoples of the west at the end of 
the eighteenth century and their drive east- 
ward explained by the activity of Louis XIV, 
XV, and XVI, their mistresses and ministers, 
and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Did- 
erot, Beaumarchais, and others? 

Is the movement of the Russian people east- 
ward to Kazan and Siberia expressed by details 
of the morbid character of Ivdn the Terrible 
and by his correspondence with Kurbski? 

Is the movement of the peoples at the time 



SECOND EPILOGUE 

of the Crusades explained by the life and 
activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and 
their ladies? For us that movement of the 
peoples from west to east, without leaders, 
with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the 
Hermit, remains incomprehensible. And yet 
more incomprehensible is the cessation of that 
movement when a rational and sacred aim for 
the Crusadethe deliverance of Jerusalem- 
had been clearly defined by historic leaders. 
Popes, kings, and knights incited the peoples 
to free the Holy Land; but the people did not 
go, for the unknown cause which had previ- 
ously impelled them to go no longer existed. 
The history of the Godfreys and the Minne- 
singers can evidently not cover the life of the 
peoples. And the history of the Godfreys and 
the Minnesingers has remained the history of 
Godfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of 
the life of the peoples and their impulses has 
remained unknown. 

Still less does the history of authors and re- 
formers explain to us the life of the peoples. 

The history of culture explains to us the 
impulses and conditions of life and thought 
of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther 
had a hot temper and said such and such 
things; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious 
and wrote such and such books; but we do 
not learn why after the Reformation the peo- 
ples massacred one another, nor why during 
the French Revolution they guillotined one 
another. 

If we unite both these kinds of history, as 
is done by the newest historians, we shall have 
the history of monarchs and writers, but not 
the history of the life of the peoples.

CHAPTER V 

THE LIFE of the nations is not contained in the 
lives of a few men, for the connection between 
those men and the nations has not been found. 
The theory that this connection is based on 
the transference of the collective will of a peo- 
ple to certain historical personages is an hy- 
pothesis unconfirmed by the experience of his- 
tory. 

The theory of the transference of the collec- 
tive will of the people to historic persons may 
perhaps explain much in the domain of juris- 
prudence and be essential for its purposes, but 
in its application to history, as soon as revolu- 
tions, conquests, or civil wars occur that is, 
as soon as history begins that theory explains 
nothing. 

The theory seems irrefutable just because 



the act of transference of the people's will can- 
not be verified, for it never occurred. 

Whatever happens and whoever may stand 
at the head of affairs, the theory can always 
say that such and such a person took the lead 
because the collective will was transferred to 
him. 

The replies this theory gives to historical 
questions are like the replies of a man who, 
watching the movements of a herd of cattle 
and paying no attention to the varying quality 
of the pasturage in different parts of the field, 
or to the driving of the herdsman, should at- 
tribute the direction the herd takes to what 
animal happens to be at its head. 

"The herd goes in that direction because 
the animal in front leads it and the collective 
will of all the other animals is vested in that 
leader." This is what historians of the first 
class say those who assume the unconditional 
transference of the people's will. 

"If the animals leading the herd change, this 
happens because the collective will of all the 
animals is transferred from one leader to an- 
other, according to whether the animal is or 
is not leading them in the direction selected 
by the whole herd." Such is the reply of his- 
torians who assume that the collective will of 
the people is delegated to rulers under condi- 
tions which they regard as known. (With this 
method of observation it often happens that 
the observer, influenced by the direction he 
himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, 
owing to the people's change of direction, are 
no longer in front, but on one side, or even 
in the rear.) 

"If the animals in front are continually 
changing and the direction of the whole herd 
is constantly altered, this is because in order 
to follow a given direction the animals trans- 
fer their will to the animals that have attracted 
our attention, and to study the movements of 
the herd we must watch the movements of all 
the prominent animals moving on all sides of 
the herd." So say the third class of historians 
who regard all historical persons, from mon- 
archs to journalists, as the expression of their 
age. 

The theory of the transference of the will 
of the people to historic persons is merely a 
paraphrase a restatement of the question in 
other words. 

What causes historical events? Power. What 
is power? Power is the collective will of the 
people transferred to one person. Under what 
condition is the will of the people delegated 



684 WAR AND PEACE 

to one person? On condition that that person 
expresses the will of the whole people. That is, 
power is power: in other words, power is a 
word the meaning of which we do not under- 
stand. 



If the realm of human knowledge were con- 
fined to abstract reasoning, then having sub- 
jected to criticism the explanation of "power" 
that juridical science gives us, humanity would 
conclude that power is merely a word and has 
no real existence. But to understand phenom- 
ena man has, besides abstract reasoning, ex- 
perience by which he verifies his reflections. 
And experience tells us that power is not mere- 
ly a word but an actually existing phenomenon. 

Not to speak of the fact that no description 
of the collective activity of men can do with- 
out the conception of power, the existence of 
power is proved both by history and by ob- 
serving contemporary events. 

Whenever an event occurs a man appears or 
men appear, by whose will the event seems to 
have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree 
and the French go to Mexico. The King of 
Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and an 
army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a 
decree and an army enters Russia. Alexander 
I gives a command and the French submit to 
the Bourbons. Experience shows us that what- 
ever event occurs it is always related to the 
will of one or of several men who have de- 
creed it. 

The historians, in accord with the old habit 
of acknowledging divine intervention in hu- 
man affairs, want to see the cause of events in 
the expression of the will of someone endowed 
with power, but that supposition is not con- 
firmed either by reason or by experience. 

On the one side reflection shows that the 
expression of a man's willhis words are only 
part of the general activity expressed in an 
event, as for instance in a war or a revolution, 
and so without assuming an incomprehensible, 
supernatural force a miracle one cannot ad- 
mit that words can be the immediate cause of 
the movements of millions of men. On the 
other hand, even if we admitted that words 
could be the cause of events, history shows 
that the expression of the will of historical 
personages does not in most cases produce any 
effect, that is to say, their commands are often 
not executed, and sometimes the very opposite 
of what they order occurs. 

Without admitting divine intervention in 
the affairs of humanity we cannot regard 



"power" as the cause of events. 

Power, from the standpoint of experience, 
is merely the relation that exists between the 
expression of someone's will and the execu- 
tion of that will by others. 

To explain the conditions of that relation- 
ship we must first establish a conception of 
the expression of will, referring it to man and 
not to the Deity. 

If the Deity issues a command, expresses 
His will, as ancient history tells us, the ex- 
pression of that will is independent of time 
and is not caused by anything, for the Divinity 
is not controlled by an event. But speaking of 
commands that are the expression of the will 
of men acting in time and in relation to one 
another, to explain the connection of com- 
mands with events we must restore: (i) the 
condition of all that takes place: the conti- 
nuity of movement in time both of the events 
and of the person who commands, and (2) the 
inevitability of the connection between the 
person commanding and those who execute 
his command. 

CHAPTER VI 

ONLY THE EXPRESSION of the will of the Deity, 
not dependent on time, can relate to a whole 
series of events occurringover a period of years 
or centuries, and only the Deity, independent 
of everything, can by His sole will determine 
the direction of humanity's movement; but 
man acts in time and himself takes part in 
what occurs. 

Reinstating the first condition omitted, that 
of time, we see that no command can be ex- 
ecuted without some preceding order having 
been given rendering the execution of the 
last command possible. 

No command ever appears spontaneously, 
or itself covers a whole series of occurrences; 
but each command follows from another, and 
never refers to a whole series of events but 
always to one moment only of an event. 

When, for instance, we say that Napoleon 
ordered armies to go to war, we combine in 
one simultaneous expression a whole series of 
consecutive commands dependent one on an- 
other. Napoleon could not have commanded 
an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today 
he ordered such and such papers to be written 
to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg; to- 
morrow such and such decrees and orders to 
the army, the fleet, the commissariat, and so 
on and so on millions of commands, which 
formed a whole series corresponding to a series 



of events which brought the French armies in- 
to Russia. 

If throughout his reign Napoleon gave com- 
mands concerning an invasion of England and 
expended on no other undertaking so much 
time and effort, and yet during his whole reign 
never once attempted to execute that design 
but undertook an expedition into Russia, with 
which country he considered it desirable to be 
in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly ex- 
pressed) this came about because his com- 
mands did not correspond to the course of 
events in the first case, but did so correspond 
in the latter. 

For an order to be certainly executed, it is 
necessary that a man should order what can 
be executed. But to know what can and what 
cannot be executed is impossible, not only in 
the case of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 
which millions participated, but even in the 
simplest event, for in either case millions of 
obstacles may arise to prevent its execution. 
Every order executed is always one of an im- 
mense number unexecuted. All the impossible 
orders inconsistent with the course of events 
remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones 
get linked up with a consecutive series of com- 
mands corresponding to a series of events, and 
are executed. 

Our false conception that an event is caused 
by a command which precedes it is due to the 
fact that when the event has taken place and 
out of thousands of others those few com- 
mands which were consistent with that event 
have been executed, we forget about the others 
that were not executed because they could 
not be. Apart from that, the chief source of 
our error in this matter is due to the fact that 
in the historical accounts a whole series of 
innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such 
for instance as all those which led the French 
armies to Russia, is generalized into one event 
in accord with the result produced by that 
series of events, and corresponding with this 
generalization the whole series of commands 
is also generalized into a single expression of 
will. 

We say that Napoleon wished to invade 
Russia and invaded it. In reality in all Na- 
poleon's activity we never find anything re- 
sembling an expression of that wish, but find 
a series of orders, or expressions of his will, 
very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid 
a long series of unexecuted orders of Napo- 
leon's one series, for the campaign of 1812, was 
carried out not because those orders differed 



SECOND EPILOGUE 685 

in any way from the other, unexecuted orders 
but because they coincided with the course of 
events that led the French army into Russia; 
just as in stencil work this or that figure comes 
out not because the color was laid on from this 
side or in that way, but because it was laid on 
from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil. 

So that examining the relation in time of 
the commands to the events, we find that a 
command can never be the cause of the event, 
but that a certain definite dependence exists 
between the two. 

To understand in what this dependence 
consists it is necessary to reinstate another 
omitted condition of every command proceed- 
ing not from the Deity but from a man, which 
is, that the man who gives the command him- 
self takes part in the event. 

This relation of the commander to those 
he commands is just what is called power. 
This relation consists in the following: 

For common action people always unite in 
certain combinations, in which regardless of 
the difference of the aims set for the common 
action, the relation between those taking part 
in it is always the same. 

Men uniting in these combinations always 
assume such relations toward one another that 
the larger number take a more direct share, 
and the smaller number a less direct share, in 
the collective action for which they have com- 
bined. 

Of all the combinations in which men unite 
for collective action one of the most striking 
and definite examples is an army. 

Every army is composed of lower grades of 
the servicethe rank and file of whom there 
are always the greatest number; of the nexi 
higher military rank corporals and noncom 
missioned officers of whom there are fewer, 
and of still-higher officers of whom there are 
still fewer, and so on to the highest military 
command which is concentrated in one per- 
son. 

A military organization may be quite cor- 
rectly compared to a cone, of which the base 
with the largest diameter consists of the rank 
and file; the next higher and smaller section 
of the cone consists of the next higher grades 
of the army, and so on to the apex, the point 
of which will represent the commander in 
chief. 

The soldiers, of whom there are the most, 
form the lower section of the cone and its 
base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, 
hacking, burning, and pillaging, and always 



686 



WAR AND PEACE 



receives orders for these actions from men 
above him; he himself never gives an order. 
The noncommissioned officers (of whom there 
are fewer) perform the action itself less fre- 
quently than the soldiers, but they already 
give commands. An officer still less often acts 
directly himself, but commands still more fre- 
quently, ^general does nothing but command 
^hejroops, in^icafes~the objective, and harcfly 
ever uses a weapon himself. The commander 
in chief never takes direct part in the action 
itself, but only gives general orders concerning 
the' movement of the mass of the troops. A 
similar relation of people to one another is 
seen in every combination of men for common 
activityin agriculture, trade, and every ad- 
ministration. 

And so without particularly analyzing all 
the contiguous sections of a cone and of the 
ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions 
in any administrative or public business what- 
ever from the lowest to the highest, we see a 
law by which men, to take associated action, 
combine in such relations that the more di- 
rectly they participate in performing the ac- 
tion the less they can command and the more 
numerous they are, while the less their direct 
participation in the action itself, the more they 
command and the fewer of them there are; 
rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the 
man at the top, who takes the least direct 
share in the action and directs his activity 
chiefly to commanding. 

This relation of the men who command to 
those they command is what constitutes the 
essence of the conception called power. 

Having restored the concTitiorToT time under 
which all events occur, we find that a command 
is executed only when it is related to a corre- 
sponding series of events. Restoring the essen- 
tial condition of relation between those who 
command and those who execute, we find that 
by the very nature of the case those who com- 
mand take the smallest part in the action it- 
self and that their activity is exclusively di- 
rected to commanding. 

CHAPTER VII 

WHEN AN EVENT is taking place people express 
their opinions and wishes about it, and as the 
event results from the collective activity of 
many people, some one of the opinions or 
wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but 
approximately. When one of the opinions ex- 
pressed is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected 
with the event as a command preceding it. 



Men are hauling a log. Each of them ex- 
presses his opinion as to how and where to 
haul it. They haul the log away, and it hap- 
pens that this is done as one of them said. He 
ordered it. There we have command and pow- 
er in their primary form. The man who worked 
most with his hands could not think so much 
about what he was doing, or reflect on or com- 
mand what would result from the common 
activity; while the man who commanded more 
would evidently work less with his hands on 
account of his greater verbal activity. 

When some larger concourse of men direct 
their activity to a common aim there is a yet 
sharper division of those who, because their 
activity is given to directing and commanding, 
take less part in the direct work. 

When a man works alone he always has a 
certain set of reflections which as it seems to 
him directed his past activity, justify his pres- 
ent activity, and guide him in planning his 
future actions. Just the same is done by a con- 
course of people, allowing those who do not 
take a direct part in the activity to devise 
considerations, justifications, and surmises con- 
cerning their collective activity. 

For reasons known or unknown to us the 
French began to drown and kill one another. 
And corresponding to the event its justifica- 
tion appears in people's belief that this was 
necessary for the welfare of France, for liberty, 
and for equality. People ceased to kill one 
another, and this event was accompanied by 
its justification in the necessity for a central- 
ization of power, resistance to Europe, and so 
on. Men went from the west to the east killing 
their fellow men, and the event was accom- 
panied by phrases about the glory of France, 
the baseness of England, and so on. History 
shows us that these justifications of the events 
have no common sense and are all contradic- 
tory, as in the case of killing a man as the re- 
sult of recognizing his rights, and the killing 
of millions in Russia for the humiliation of 
England. But these justifications have a very 
necessary significance in their own day. 

These justifications release those who pro- 
duce the events from moral responsibility. 
These temporary aims are like the broom fixed 
in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from 
the rails in front: they clear men's moral re- 
sponsibilities from their path. 

Without such justification there would be 
no reply to the simplest question that presents 
itself when examining each historical event. 
How is it that millions of men commit collec- 



SECOND EPILOGUE 

tive crimesmake war, commit murder, and 
so on? 

With the present complex forms of political 
and social life in Europe can any event that is 
not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by mon- 
archs, ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be 
imagined? Is there any collective action which 
cannot find its justification in political unity, 
in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in 
civilization? So that every event that occurs 
inevitably coincides with some expressed wish 
and, receiving a justification, presents itself 
as the result of the will of one man or of 
several men. 

In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow 
of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable 
ahead of it. To those on board the ship the 
movement of those waves will be the only per- 
ceptible motion. 

Only by watching closely moment by mo- 
ment the movement of that flow and compar- 
ing it with the movement of the ship do we 
convince ourselves that every bit of it is oc- 
casioned by the forward movement of the 
ship, and that we were led into error by the 
fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly mov- 
ing. 

We see the same if we watch moment by 
moment the movement of historical characters 
(that is, re-establish the inevitable condition 
of all that occurs the continuity of move- 
ment in time) and do not lose sight of the 
essential connection of historical persons with 
the masses. 

When the ship moves in one direction there 
is one and the same wave ahead of it, when 
it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also 
turns frequently. But wherever it may turn 
there always will be the wave anticipating its 
movement. 

Whatever happens it always appears that 
just that event was foreseen and decreed. 
Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water 
which neither directs nor increases its move- 
ment foams ahead of it, and at a distance 
seems to us not merely to move of itself but 
to govern the ship's movement also. 



687 



Examining only those expressions of the 
will of historical persons which, as commands, 
were related to events, historians have assumed 
that the events depended on those com- 
mands. But examining the events themselves 
and the connection in which the historical 
persons stood to the people, we have found 
that they and their orders were dependent on 



events. The incontestable proof of this deduc- 
tion is that, however many commands were 
issued, the event does not take place unless 
there are other causes for it, but as soon as an 
event occurs be it what it may then out of 
all the continually expressed wishes of dif- 
ferent people some will always be found which 
by their meaning and their time of utterance 
are related as commands to the events. 

Arriving at this conclusion we can reply di- 
rectly and positively to these two essential 
questions of history: 

(1) What is power? 

(2) What force produces the movement of 
the nations? 

(1) Power is the relation of a given person 
to other individuals, in which the more this 
person expresses opinions, predictions, and 
justifications of the collective action that is 
performed, the less is his participation in that 
action. 

(2) The movement of nations is caused not 
by power, nor by intellectual activity, nor 
even by a combination of the two as historians 
have supposed, but by the activity of all the 
people who participate in the events, and who 
always combine in such a way that those tak- 
ing the largest direct share in the event take 
on themselves the least responsibility and vice 
versa. 

Morally the wi elder of power appears to 
cause the event; physically it is those who sub- 
mit to the power. But as the moral activity is 
inconceivable without the physical, the cause 
of the event is neither in the one nor in the 
other but in the union of the two. 

Or in other words, the conception of a cause 
is inapplicable to the phenomena we are ex- 
amining. 

In the last analysis we reach the circle of 
infinity that final limit to which in every do- 
main of thought man's reason arrives if it is 
not playing with the subject. Electricity pro- 
duces heat, heat produces electricity. Atoms 
attract each other and atoms repel one an- 
other. 

Speaking of the interaction of heat and elec- 
tricity and of atoms, we cannot say why this 
occurs, and we say that it is so because it is 
inconceivable otherwise, because it must be 
so and that it is a law. The same applies to 
historical events. Why war and revolution oc- 
cur we do not know. We only know that to 
produce the one or the other action, people 
combine in a certain formation in which they 
all take part, and we say that this is so because 



688 



WAR AND PEACE 



it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words 
that it is a law. 

CHAPTER VIII 

IF HISTORY DEALT only with external phenom- 
ena, the establishment of this simple and ob- 
vious law would suffice and we should have 
finished our argument. But the law of history 
relates to man. A particle of matter cannot tell 
us that it does not feel the law of attraction or 
repulsion and that that law is untrue, but 
man, who is thesubject of history, says plainly: 
I am free and am therefore not subject to 
the law. 

The presence of the problem of man's free 
will, though unexpressed, is felt at every step 
of history. 

All seriously thinking historians have in- 
voluntarily encountered this question. All the 
contradictions and obscurities of history and 
the false path historical science has followed 
are due solely to the lack of a solution of 
that question. 

If the will of every man were free, that is, 
if each man could act as he pleased, all history 
would be a series of disconnected incidents. 

If in a thousand years even one man in a 
million could act freely, that is, as he chose, 
it is evident that one single free act of that 
man's in violation of the laws governing hu- 
man action would destroy the possibility of 
the existence of any laws for die whole of 
humanity. 

If there be a single law governing the ac- 
tions of men, free will cannot exist, for then 
man's will is subject to that law. 

In this contradiction lies the problem of 
free will, which from most ancient times has 
occupied the best human minds and from most 
ancient times has been presented in its whole 
tremendous significance. 

The problem is that regarding man as a sub- 
ject of observation from whatever point of 
view theological, historical, ethical, or phil- 
osophicwe find a general law of necessity to 
which he (like all that exists) is subject. But 
regarding him from within ourselves as what 
we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be 
free. 

This consciousness is a source of self-cogni- 
tion quite apart from and independent of 
reason. Through his reason man observes him- 
self, but only through consciousness does he 
know himself. 

Apart from consciousness of self no observa- 
tion or application of reason is conceivable. 



To understand, observe, and draw conclu- 
sions, man must first of all be conscious of him- 
self as living. A man is only conscious of him- 
self as a living being by the fact that he wills, 
that is, is conscious of his volition. But his will 
which forms the essence of his life man 
recognizes (and can but recognize) as free. 

If, observing himself, man sees that his will 
is always directed by one and the same law 
(whether he observes the necessity of taking 
food, using his brain, or anything else) he can- 
not recognize this never-varying direction of 
his will otherwise than as a limitation of it. 
Were it not free it could not be limited. A 
man's will seems to him to be limited just be- 
cause he is not conscious of it except as free. 

You say: I am not free. But I have lifted my 
hand and let it fall. Everyone understands 
that this illogical reply is an irrefutable dem- 
onstration of freedom. 

That reply is the expression of a conscious- 
ness that is not subject to reason. 

If the consciousness of freedom were not a 
separate and independent source of self-con- 
sciousness it would be subject to reasoning 
and to experience, but in fact such subjection 
does not exist and is inconceivable. 

A series of experiments and arguments 
proves to every man that he, as an object of 
observation, is subject to certain laws, and man 
submits to them and never resists the laws of 
gravity or impermeability once he has become 
acquainted with them. But the same series of 
experiments and arguments proves to him that 
the complete freedom of which he is conscious 
in himself is impossible, and that his every 
action depends on his organization, his char- 
acter, and the motives acting upon him; yet 
man never submits to the deductions of these 
experiments and arguments. Having learned 
from experiment and argument that a stone 
falls downwards, a man indubitably believes 
this and always expects the law that he has 
learned to be fulfilled. 

But learning just as certainly that his will 
is subject to laws, he does not and cannot be- 
lieve this. 

However often experiment and reasoning 
may show a man that under the same condi- 
tions and with the same character he will do 
the same thing as before, yet when under the 
same conditions an&lt;} with the same character 
he approaches for the thousandth time the ac- 
tion that always ends in the same way, he feels 
as certainly convinced as before the experi- 
ment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, 



SECOND EPILOGUE 

savage or sage, however incontestably reason 
and experiment may prove to him that it is 
impossible to imagine two different courses 
of action in precisely the same conditions, 
feels that without this irrational conception 
(which constitutes the essence of freedom) he 
cannot imagine life. He feels that however im- 
possible it may be, it is so, for without this 
conception of freedom not only would he be 
unable to understand life, but he would be 
unable to live for a single moment. 

He could not live, because all man's efforts, 
all his impulses to life, are only efforts to in- 
crease freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame 
and obscurity, power and subordination, 
strength and weakness, health and disease, cul- 
ture and ignorance, work and leisure, reple- 
tion and hunger, virtue and vice, are only 
greater or lesser degrees of freedom. 

A man having no freedom cannot be con- 
ceived of except as deprived of life. 

If the conception of freedom appears to 
reason to be a senseless contradiction like the 
possibility of performing two actions at one 
and the same instant of time, or of an effect 
without a cause, that only proves that con- 
sciousness is not subject to reason. 

This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness 
of freedom, uncontrolled by experiment or 
argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt 
by everyone without exception, this conscious- 
ness without which no conception of man is 
possible constitutes the other side of the ques- 
tion. 

Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all- 
good, and all-seeing God. What is sin, the 
conception of which arises from the conscious- 
ness of man's freedom? That is a question for 
theology. 

The actions of men are subject to general 
immutable laws expressed in statistics. What 
is man's responsibility to society, the concep- 
tion of which results from the conception of 
freedom? That is a question for jurisprudence. 

Man's actions proceed from his innate char- 
acter and the motives acting upon him. What 
is conscience and the perception of right and 
wrong in actions that follows from the con- 
sciousness of freedom? That is a question for 
ethics. 

Man in connection with the general life of 
humanity appears subject to laws which de- 
termine that life. But the same man apart from 
that connection appears to be free. How should 
the past life of nations and of humanity be 
regarded as the result of the free, or as the 



689 

result of the constrained, activity of man? That 
is a question for history. 

Only in our self-confident day of the popu- 
larization of knowledge thanks to that most 
powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of 
printed matter has the question of the free- 
dom of will been put on a level on which the 
question itself cannot exist. In our time the 
majority of so-called advanced people that is, 
the crowd of ignoramuses have taken the work 
of the naturalists who deal with one side of the 
question for a solution of the whole problem. 

They say and write and print that the soul 
and freedom do not exist, for the life of man 
is expressed by muscular movements and mus- 
cular movements are conditioned by the ac- 
tivity of the nerves; the soul and free will do 
not exist because at an unknown period of time 
we sprang from the apes. They say this, not at 
all suspecting that thousands of years ago that 
same law of necessity which with such ardor 
they are now trying to prove by physiology and 
comparative zoology was not merely acknowl- 
edged by all the religions and all the thinkers, 
but has never been denied. They do not see 
that the role of the natural sciences in this 
matter is merely to serve as an instrument for 
the illumination of one side of it. For the fact 
that, from the point of view of observation, 
reason and the will are merely secretions of the 
brain, and that man following the general law 
may have developed from lower animals at 
some unknown period of time, only explains 
from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands 
of years ago by all the religious and philosophic 
theories that from the point of view of rea- 
son man is subject to the law of necessity; but 
it does not advance by a hair's breadth the solu- 
tion of the question, which has another, oppo- 
site, side, based on the consciousness of free- 
dom. 

If men descended from the apes at an un- 
known period of time, that is as comprehen- 
sible as that they were made from a handful of 
earth at a certain period of time (in the first 
case the unknown quantity is the time, in the 
second case it is the origin); and the question 
of how man's consciousness of freedom is to 
be reconciled with the law of necessity to 
which he is subject cannot be solved by com- 
parative physiology and zoology, for in a frog, 
a rabbit, or an ape, we can observe only the 
muscular nervous activity, but in man we ob- 
serve consciousness as well as the muscular and 
nervous activity. 

The naturalists and their followers, think- 



690 WAR AND PEACE 

ing they can solve this question, are like plas- 
terers set to plaster one side of the walls of a 
church who, availing themselves of the ab- 
sence of the chief superintendent of the work, 
should in an access of zeal plaster over the 
windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbut- 
tressed walls, and should be delighted that 
from their point of view as plasterers, every- 
thing is now so smooth and regular. 



CHAPTER IX 

FOR THE SOLUTION of the question of free will 
or inevitability, history has this advantage over 
other branches of knowledge in which the 
question is dealt with, that for history this 
question does not refer to the essence of man's 
free will but to its manifestation in the past and 
under certain conditions. 

In regard to this question, history stands to 
the other sciences as experimental science 
stands to abstract science. 

The subject for history is not man's will 
itself but our presentation of it. 

And so for history, the insoluble mystery 
presented by the incompatibility of free will 
and inevitability does not exist as it does for 
theology, ethics, and philosophy. History sur- 
veys a presentation of man's life in which the 
union of these two contradictions has already 
taken place. 

In actual life each historic event, each hu- 
man action, is very clearly and definitely un- 
derstood without any sense of contradiction, 
although each event presents itself as partly 
free and partly compulsory. 

To solve the question of how freedom and 
necessity are combined and what constitutes 
the essence of these two conceptions, the phi- 
losophy of history can and should follow a 
path contrary to that taken by other sciences. 
Instead of first defining the conceptions of free- 
dom and inevitability in themselves, and then 
ranging the phenomena of life under those 
definitions, history should deduce a definition 
of the conception of freedom and inevitability 
themselves from the immense quantity of phe- 
nomena of which it is cognizant and that al- 
ways appear dependent on these two elements. 

Whatever presentation of the activity of 
many men or of an individual we may con- 
sider, we always regard it as the result partly 
of man's free will and partly of the law of in- 
evitability. 

Whether we speak of the migration of the 
peoples and the incursions of the barbarians, 
or of the decrees of Napoleon HI, or of some- 



one's action an hour ago in choosing one direc- 
tion out of several for his walk, we are uncon- 
scious of any contradiction, The degree of free- 
dom and inevitability governing the actions 
of these people is clearly defined for us. 

Our conception of the degree of freedom 
often varies according to differences in the 
point of view from which we regard the event, 
but every human action appears to us as a 
certain combination of freedom and inevita- 
bility. In every action we examine we see a 
certain measure of freedom and a certain 
measure of inevitability. And always the more 
freedom we see in any action the less inevita- 
bility do we perceive, and the more inevitabil- 
ity the less freedom. 

The proportion of freedom to inevitability 
decreases and increases according to the point 
of view from which the action is regarded, but 
their relation is always one of inverse propor- 
tion. 

A sinking man who clutches at another and 
drowns him; or a hungry mother exhausted by 
feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a 
man trained to discipline who on duty at the 
word of command kills a defenseless man- 
seem less guilty, that is, less free and more 
subject to the law of necessity, to one who 
knows the circumstances in which these peo- 
ple were placed, and more free to one who does 
not know that the man was himself drowning, 
that the mother was hungry, that the soldier 
was in the ranks, and so on. Similarly a man 
who committed a murder twenty years ago 
and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly 
in society seems less guilty and his action more 
due to the law of inevitability, to someone who 
considers his action after twenty years have 
elapsed than to one who examined it the day 
after it was committed. And in the same way 
every action of an insane, intoxicated, or high- 
ly excited man appears less free and more in- 
evitable to one who knows the mental condi- 
tion of him who committed the action, and 
seems more free and less inevitable to one who 
does not know it. In all these cases the con- 
ception of freedom is increased or diminished 
and the conception of compulsion is corre- 
spondingly decreased or increased, according 
to the point of view from which the action is 
regarded. So that the greater the conception ol 
necessity the smaller the conception of free- 
dom and vice versa. 

Religion, the common sense of mankind, 
the science of jurisprudence, and history it 
self understand alike this relation between 



SECOND EPILOGUE 

necessity and freedom. 

All cases without exception in which our 
conception of freedom and necessity is in- 
creased and diminished depend on three con- 
siderations: 

(1) The relation to the external world of 
the man who commits the deeds. 

(2) His relation to time. 

(3) His relation to the causes leading to the 
action. 

The first consideration is the clearness of 
our perception of the man's relation to the 
external world and the greater or lesser clear- 
ness of our understanding of the definite posi- 
tion occupied by the man in relation to every- 
thing coexisting with him. This is what makes 
it evident that a drowning man is less free and 
more subject to necessity than one standing on 
dry ground, and that makes the actions of a 
man closely connected with others in a thickly 
populated district, or of one bound by family, 
official, or business duties, seem certainly less 
free and more subject to necessity than those 
of a man living in solitude and seclusion. 

If we consider a man alone, apart from his 
relation to everything around him, each ac- 
tion of his seems to us free. But if we see his 
relation to anything around him, if we see his 
connection with anything whatever with a 
man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the 
work on which he is engaged, even with the 
air he breathes or the light that falls on the 
things about him we see that each of these 
circumstances has an influence on him and 
controls at least some side of his activity. And 
the more we perceive of these influences the 
more our conception of his freedom dimin- 
ishes and the more our conception of the neces- 
sity that weighs on him increases. 

The second consideration is the more or less 
evident time relation of the man to the world 
and the clearness of our perception of the 
place the man's action occupies in time. That 
is the ground which makes the fall of the first 
man, resulting in the production of the hu- 
man race, appear evidently less free than a 
man's entry into marriage today. It is the 
reason why the life and activity of people who 
lived centuries ago and are connected with 
me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life 
of a contemporary, the consequences of which 
are still unknown to me. 

The degree of our conception of freedom or 
inevitability depends in this respect on the 
greater or lesser lapse of time between the per- 
formance of the action and our judgment of it. 



691 

If I examine an act I performed a moment 
ago in approximately the same circumstances 
as those I am in now, my action appears to me 
undoubtedly free. But if I examine an act 
performed a month ago, then being in differ- 
ent circumstances, I cannot help recognizing 
that if that act had not been committed much 
that resulted from it good, agreeable, and 
even essential would not have taken place. If 
I reflect on an action still more remote, ten 
years ago or more, then the consequences of my 
action are still plainer to me and I find it hard 
to imagine what would have happened had 
that action not been performed. The farther 
I go back in memory, or what is the same thing 
the farther I go forward in my judgment, the 
more doubtful becomes my belief in the free- 
dom of my action. 

In history we find a very similar progress of 
conviction concerning the part played by free 
will in the general affairs of humanity. A con- 
temporary event seems to us to be indubitably 
the doing of all the known participants, but 
with a more remote event we already see its in- 
evitable results which prevent our considering 
anything else possible. And the farther we go 
back in examining events the less arbitrary do 
they appear. 

The Austro-Prussian war appears to us un- 
doubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of 
Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars 
still seem to us, though already questionably, 
to be the outcome of their heroes' will. But 
in the Crusades we already see an event occupy- 
ing its definite place in history and without 
which we cannot imagine the modern history 
of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the 
Crusades that event appeared as merely due to 
the will of certain people. In regard to the 
migration of the peoples it does not enter any- 
one's head today to suppose that the renova- 
tion of the European world depended on At- 
tila's caprice. The farther back in history the 
object of our observation lies, the more doubt- 
ful does the free will of those concerned in 
the event become and the more manifest the 
law of inevitability. 

The third consideration is the degree to 
which we apprehend that endless chain of cau- 
sation inevitably demanded by reason, in 
which each phenomenon comprehended, and 
therefore man's every action, must have its 
definite place as a result of what has gone be- 
fore and as a cause of what will follow. 

The better we are acquainted with the physi- 
ological, psychological) and historical laws de- 



69* 



WAR AND PEACE 



duced by observation and by which man is con- 
trolled, and the more correctly we perceive 
the physiological, psychological, and historical 
causes of the action, and the simpler the action 
we are observing and the less complex the 
character and mind of the man in question, 
the more subject to inevitability and the less 
free do our actions and those of others appear. 

When we do not at all understand the cause 
of an action, whether a crime, a good action, 
or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe 
a greater amount of freedom to it. In the case 
of a crime we most urgently demand the pun- 
ishment for such an act; in the case of a virtu- 
ous act we rate its merit most highly. In an 
indifferent case we recognize in it more indi- 
viduality, originality, and independence. But 
if even one of the innumerable causes of the 
act is known to us we recognize a certain ele- 
ment of necessity and are less insistent on pun- 
ishment for the crime, or the acknowledgment 
of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom 
of the apparently original action. That a crimi- 
nal was reared among malefactors mitigates his 
fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father 
or mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility 
of a reward, is more comprehensible than gra- 
tuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less 
deserving of sympathy and less the result of 
free will. The founder of a sect or party, or an 
inventor, impresses us less when we know how 
or by what the way was prepared for his activ- 
ity. If we have a large range of examples, if 
our observation is constantly directed to seek- 
ing the correlation of cause and effect in peo- 
ple's actions, their actions appear to us more 
under compulsion and less free the more cor- 
rectly we connect the effects with the causes. 
If we examined simple actions and had a vast 
number of such actions under observation, our 
conception of their inevitability would be still 
greater. The dishonest conduct of the son of 
a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman 
who had fallen into bad company, a drunkard's 
relapse into drunkenness, and so on are ac- 
tions that seem to us less free the better we 
understand their cause. If the man whose ac- 
tions we are considering is on a very low stage 
of mental development, like a child, a mad- 
man, or a simpleton then, knowing the causes 
of the act and the simplicity of the character 
and intelligence in question, we see so large 
an element of necessity and so little free will 
that as soon as we know the cause prompting 
the action we can foretell the result. 

On these three considerations alone is based 



the conception of irresponsibility for crimes 
and the extenuating circumstances admitted 
by all legislative codes. The responsibility ap- 
pears greater or less according to our greater 
or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in 
which the man was placed whose action is 
being judged, and according to the greater or 
lesser interval of time between the commission 
of the action and its investigation, and accord- 
ing to the greater or lesser understanding of 
the causes that led to the action. 

CHAPTER X 

THUS OUR CONCEPTION of free will and inevita- 
bility gradually diminishes or increases ac- 
cording to the greater or lesser connection 
with the external world, the greater or lesser 
remoteness of time, and the greater or lesser 
dependence on the causes in relation to which 
we contemplate a man's life. 

So that if we examine the case of a man 
whose connection with the external world is 
well known, where the time between the action 
and its examination is great, and where the 
causes of the action are most accessible, we get 
the conception of a maximum of inevitability 
and a minimum of free will. If we examine a 
man little dependent on external conditions, 
whose action was performed very recently, and 
the causes of whose action are beyond our 
ken, we get the conception of a minimum of 
inevitability and a maximum of freedom. 

In neither case however we may change 
our point of view, however plain we may make 
to ourselves the connection between the man 
and the external world, however inaccessible 
it may be to us, however long or short the 
period of time, however intelligible or incom- 
prehensible the causes of the action may be 
can we ever conceive either complete freedom 
or complete necessity. 

(i) To whatever degree we may imagine a 
man to be exempt from the influence of the 
external world, we never get a conception of 
freedom in space. Every human action is in- 
evitably conditioned by what surrounds him 
and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it 
fall. My action seems to me free; but asking 
myself whether I could raise my arm in every 
direction, I see that I raised it in the direction 
in which there was least obstruction to that 
action either from things around me or from 
the construction of my own body. I chose one 
out of all the possible directions because in 
it there were fewest obstacles. For my action to 
be free it was necessary that it should encoun- 



SECOND EPILOGUE 

ter no obstacles. To conceive of a man being 
free we must imagine him outside space, which 
is evidently impossible. 

(*) However much we approximate the time 
of judgment to the time of the deed, we never 
get a conception of freedom in time. For if I 
examine an action committed a second ago I 
must still recognize it as not being free, for it 
is irrevocably linked to the moment at which 
it was committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, 
but ask myself: could I have abstained from 
lifting my arm at the moment that has already 
passed? To convince myself of this I do not lift 
it the next moment. But I am not now abstain- 
ing from doing so at the first moment when I 
asked the question. Time has gone by which 
I could not detain, the arm I then lifted is no 
longer the same as the arm I now refrain from 
lifting, nor is the air in which I lifted it the 
same that now surrounds me. The moment in 
which the first movement was made is irrevoca- 
ble, and at that moment I could make only 
one movement, and whatever movement I 
made would be the only one. That I did not 
lift my arm a moment later does not prove that 
I could have abstained from lifting it then. 
And since I could make only one movement at 
that single moment of time, it could not have 
been any other. To imagine it as free, it is 
necessary to imagine it in the present, on the 
boundary between the past and the future 
that is, outside time, which is impossible. 

(3) However much the difficulty of under- 
standing the causes may be increased, we never 
reach a conception of complete freedom, that 
is, an absence ot cause. However inaccessible 
to us may be the cause of the expression of will 
in any action, our own or another's, the first 
demand of reason is the assumption of and 
search for a cause, for without a cause no phe- 
nomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to 
perform an action independently of any cause, 
but my wish to perform an action without a 
cause is the cause of my action. 

But even if imagining a man quite exempt 
from all influences, examining only his mo- 
mentary action in the present, unevoked by 
any cause we were to admit so infinitely small 
a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero, 
we should even then not have arrived at the 
conception of complete freedom in man, for a 
being uninfluenced by the external world, 
standing outside of time and independent of 
cause, is no longer a man. 

In the same way we can never imagine the 
action of a man quite devoid of freedom and 



693 

entirely subject to the law of inevitability. 

(i) However we may increase our knowl- 
edge of the conditions of space in which man 
is situated, that knowledge can never be com- 
plete, for the number of those conditions is as 
infinite as the infinity of space. And therefore 
so long as not all the conditions influencing 
men are defined, there is no complete inevita- 
bility but a certain measure of freedom re- 
mains. 

(a) However we may prolong the period' of 
time between the action we are examining and 
the judgment upon it, that period will be 
finite, while time is infinite, and so in this re- 
spect too there can never be absolute inevita- 
bility. 

(3) However accessible may be the chain of 
causation of any action, we shall never know 
the whole chain since it is endless, and so again 
we never reach absolute inevitability. 

But besides this, even if, admitting the re- 
maining minimum of freedom to equal zero, 
we assumed in some given case as for instance 
in that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an 
idiot complete absence of freedom, by so do- 
ing we should destroy the very conception of 
man in the case we are examining, for as soon 
as there is no freedom there is also no man. 
And so the conception of the action of a man 
subject solely to the law of inevitability with- 
out any element of freedom is just as impossi- 
ble as the conception of a man's completely 
free action. 

And so to imagine the action of a man en- 
tirely subject to the law of inevitability with- 
out any freedom, we must assume the knowl- 
edge of an infinite number of space relations, 
an infinitely long period of time, and an in- 
finite series of causes. 

To imagine a man perfectly free and not 
subject to the law of inevitability, we must 
imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond 
time, and free from dependence on cause. 

In the first case, if inevitability were possible 
without freedom we should have reached a 
definition of inevitability by the laws of in- 
evitability itself, that is, a mere form without 
content. 

In the second case, if freedom were possible 
without inevitability we should have arrived 
at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, 
and cause, which by the fact of its being un- 
conditioned and unlimited would be nothing, 
or mere content without form. * 

We should in fact have reached those two 
fundamentals of which man's whole outlook 



694 WAR AND PEACE 

on the universe is constructedthe incompre- 
hensible essence of life, and the laws defining 
that essence. 

Reason says: (i) space with all the forms of 
matter that give it visibility is infinite, and 
cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is 
infinite motion without a moment of rest and 
is unthinkable otherwise. (3) The connection 
between cause and effect has no beginning and 
can have no end. 

Consciousness says: (i) I alone am, and all 
that exists is but me, consequently I include 
space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed 
moment of the present in which alone I am 
conscious of myself as living, consequently I 
am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I 
feel myself to be the cause of every manifesta- 
tion of my life. 

Reason gives expression to the laws of in- 
evitability. Consciousness gives expression to 
the essence of freedom. 

Freedom not limited by anything is the es- 
sence of life, in man's consciousness. Inevita- 
bility without content is man's reason in its 
three forms. 

Freedom is the thing examined. Inevitabil- 
ity is what examines. Freedom is the content. 
Inevitability is the form. 

Only by separating the two sources of cogni- 
tion, related to one another as form to con- 
tent, do we get the mutually exclusive and 
separately incomprehensible conceptions of 
freedom and inevitability. 

Only by uniting them do we get a clear con- 
ception of man's life. 

Apart from these two concepts which in 
their union mutually define one another as 
form and content, no conception of life is 
possible. 

All that we know of the life of man is merely 
a certain relation of free will to inevitability, 
that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason. 

All that we know of the external world of 
nature is only a certain relation of the forces 
of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of 
life to the laws of reason. 

The great natural forces lie outside us and 
we are not conscious of them; we call those 
forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal 
force, and so on, but we are conscious of the 
force of life in man and we call that freedom. 

But just as the force of gravitation, incom- 
prehensible in itself but felt by every man, is 
understood by us only to the extent to which 
we know the laws of inevitability to which it 
is subject (from the first knowledge that all 



bodies have weight, up to Newton's law), so 
too the force of free will, incomprehensible in 
itself but of which everyone is conscious, is in- 
telligible to us only in as far as we know the 
laws of inevitability to which it is subject 
(from the fact that every man dies, up to the 
knowledge of the most complex economic and 
historic laws). 

All knowledge is merely a bringing of this 
essence of life under the laws of reason. 

Man's free will differs from every other force 
in that man is directly conscious of it, but in 
the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any 
other force. The forces of gravitation, electric- 
ity, or chemical affinity are only distinguished 
from one another in that they are differently 
defined by reason. Just so the force of man's 
free will is distinguished by reason from the 
other forces of natureonly by the definition rea- 
son gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, 
that is, apart from the laws of reason that de- 
fine it, differs in no way from gravitation, or 
heat, or the force that makes things grow; for 
reason, it is only a momentary undefinable sen- 
sation of life. 

And as the undefinable essence of the force 
moving the heavenly bodies, the undefinable 
essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or 
of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms 
the content of astronomy, physics, chemistry, 
botany, zoology, and so on, just in the same 
way does the force of free will form the con- 
tent of history. But just as the subject of every 
science is the manifestation of this unknown 
essence of life while that essence itself can only 
be the subject of metaphysics, even so the mani- 
festation of the force of free will in human be- 
ings in space, in time, and in dependence on 
cause forms the subject of history, while free 
will itself is the subject of metaphysics. 

In the experimental sciences what we know 
we call the laws of inevitability, what is un- 
known to us we call vital force. Vital force is 
only an expression lor the unknown remainder 
over and above what we know of the essence 
of life. 

So also in history what is known to us we 
call laws of inevitability, what is unknown we 
call free will. Free will is for history only an 
expression for the unknown remainder of what 
we know about the laws of human life. 



CHAPTER XI 

HISTORY EXAMINES the manifestations of man's 
free will in connection with the external world 
in time and in dependence on cause, that is, 



SECOND EPILOGUE 

it defines this freedom by the laws of reason, 
and so history is a science only in so far as 
this free will is defined by those laws. 

The recognition of man's free will as some- 
thing capable of influencing historical events, 
that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for 
history as the recognition of a free force mov- 
ing the heavenly bodies would be for astron- 
omy. 

1'hat assumption would destroy the possi- 
bility of the existence of la\^, that is, of any 
science whatever. If there is even a single body 
moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and 
Newton are negatived and no conception of 
the movement of the heavenly bodies any 
longer exists. If any single action is due to free 
will, then not a single historical law can exist, 
nor any conception of historical events. 
, For history, lines exist of the movement of 
human wills, one end of which is hidden in the 
unknown but at the other end of which a con- 
sciousness of man's will in the present moves 
in space, time, and dependence on cause. 

The more this field of motion spreads out 
before our eyes, the more evident are the laws 
of that movement. To discover and define those 
laws is the problem of history. 

From the standpoint from which the science 
of history now regards its subject on the path it 
now follows, seeking the causes of events in 
man's freewill, a scientific enunciation of those 
laws is impossible, for however man's free will 
may be restricted, as soon as we recognize it as 
a force not subject to law, the existence of law 
becomes impossible. 

Only by reducing this element of free will 
to the infinitesimal, that is, by regarding it as 
an infinitely small quantity, can we convince 
ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the 
causes, and then instead of seeking causes, his- 
tory will take the discovery of laws as its 
problem. 

The search for these laws has long been be- 
gun and the new methods of thought which 
history must adopt are being worked out si- 
multaneously with the self-destruction toward 
whichever dissecting and dissecting the causes 
of phenomenathe old method of history is 
moving. 

All human sciences have traveled along that 
path. Arriving at infinitesimals, mathematics, 
the most exact of sciences, abandons the proc- 
ess of analysis and enters on the new process 
of the integration of unknown, infinitely small, 
quantities. Abandoning the conception of 
cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the prop- 



695 

erty common to all unknown, infinitely small, 
elements. 

In another form but along the same path of 
reflection the other sciences have proceeded. 
When Newton enunciated the law of gravity 
he did not say that the sun or the earth had a 
property of attraction; he said that all bodies 
from the largest to the smallest have the prop- 
erty of attracting one another, that is, leaving 
aside the question of the cause of the move- 
ment of the bodies, he expressed the property 
common to all bodies from the infinitely large 
to the infinitely sraall.The same is done by the 
natural sciences: leaving aside the question of 
cause, they seek for laws. History stands on the 
same path. And if history has for its object the 
study of the movement of the nations and of 
humanity and not the narration of episodes in 
the lives of individuals, it too, setting aside the 
conception of cause, should seek the laws com- 
mon to all the inseparably interconnected in- 
finitesimal elements of free will. 

CHAPTER XII 

FROM THE TIME the law of Copernicus was dis- 
covered and proved, the mere recognition of 
the fact that it was not the sun but the earth 
that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cos- 
mography of the ancients. By disproving that 
law it might have been possible to retain the 
old conception of the movements of the bodies, 
but without disproving it, it would seem im- 
possible to continue studying the Ptolemaic 
worlds. But even after the discovery of the law 
of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still 
studied for a long time. 

From the time the first person said and 
proved that the number of births or of crimes 
is subject to mathematical laws, and that this 
or that mode of government is determined by 
certain geographical and economic conditions, 
and that certain relations of population to soil 
produce migrations of peoples, the foundations 
on which history had been built were destroyed 
in their essence. 

By refuting these new laws the former view 
of history might have been retained; but with- 
out refuting them it would seem impossible to 
continue studying historic events as the results 
of man's free will. For if a certain mode of gov- 
ernment was established or certain migrations 
of peoples took place in consequence of such 
and such geographic, ethnographic, or eco- 
nomic conditions, then the free will of those 
individuals who appear to us to have estab- 
lished that mode of government or occasioned 



696 

the migrations can no longer be regarded as 
the cause. 

And yet the former history continues to be 
studied side by side with the laws of statistics, 
geography, political economy, comparative 
philology, and geology, which directly contra- 
dict its assumptions. 

The struggle between the old views and the 
new was long and stubbornly fought out in 
physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard 
for the old views and accused the new of vio- 
lating revelation. But when truth conquered, 
theology established itself just as firmly on the 
new foundation. 

Just as prolonged and stubborn is the strug- 
gle now proceeding between the old and the 
new conception of history, and theology in the 
same way stands on guard for the old view, and 
accuses the new view of subverting revelation. 

In the one case as in the other, on both sides 
the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth. 
On the one hand there is fear and regret for 
the loss of the whole edifice constructed through 
the ages, on the other is the passion for de- 
struction. 

To the men who fought against the rising 
truths of physical philosophy, it seemed that 
if they admitted that truth it would destroy 
faith in God, in the creation of the firmament, 
and in the miracle of Joshua the son of Nun. 
To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and 
Newton, to Voltaire for example, it seemed 
that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion, 
and he utilized the law of gravitation as a 
weapon against religion. 

Just so it now seems as if we have only to 
admit the law of inevitability, to destroy the 
conception of the soul, of good and evil, and 
all the institutions of state and church that 
have been built up on those conceptions. 

So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited 



WAR AND PEACE 



defenders of the law of inevitability today use 
that law as a weapon against religion, though 
the law of inevitability in history, like the law 
of Copernicus in astronomy, far from de- 
stroying,- even strengthens the foundation on 
which the institutions of state and church are 
erected. 

As in the question of astronomy then, so in 
the question of history now, the whole differ- 
ence of opinion is based on the recognition or 
nonrecognition pf something absolute, serv- 
ing as the measure of visible phenomena. In 
astronomy it was the immovability of the 
earth, in history it is the independence of per- 
sonalityfree will. 

As with astronomy the difficulty of recogniz- 
ing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning 
the immediate sensation of the earth's fixity 
and of the motion of the planets, so in history 
the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of 
personality to the laws of space, time, and cause 
lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the in- 
dependence of one's own personality. But as 
in astronomy the new view said: "It is true that 
we do not feel the movement of the earth, but 
by admitting its immobility we arrive at ab- 
surdity, while by admitting its motion (which 
we do not feel) we arrive at laws," so also in 
history the new view says: "It is true that we 
are not conscious of our dependence, but by 
admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity, 
while by admitting our dependence on the 
external world, on time, and on cause, we 
arrive at laws." 

In the first case it was necessary to renounce 
the consciousness of an unreal immobility in 
space and to recognize a motion we did not 
feel; in the present case it is similarly necessary 
to renounce a freedom that does not exist, and 
to recognize a dependence of which we are 
not conscious.
